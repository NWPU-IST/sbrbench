All the cluster nodes are built on centos 6.0.During the ambari server installation  ambari-server recognized the primary/cluster os as redhat6 (see ambari.properties). During the ambari agent bootstrap/host register  ambari-agent regonized the agent os as centos linux6 (see log). From log files (ambari-server.log  ambari-agent.log)  I found the inconsistence caused the warning of ambari-agent bootstrapping and failure of host registering.I'm still not sure why this happen  but I guess it's caused by the differene of os checking methods among ambari server side code  ambari-agent bootstrap script (os_type_check.sh based on os release file) and registering script (Controller.py/Register.py based on os hardware profile) .I just share to see if anyone can fix the issue.BTW  for me  to solve the problem  I manually edited the script files to make it work temporarily:To avoid warning of agent bootstrapping  in os_type_check.sh  add current_os=$RH6 above the echo line or add res=0 after case statement;To make the node register work  in Controller.py  add data=data.replace('centos linux' 'redhat') before sending registering request;Thanks.,1.4.3,1.5.1,0,2,170,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0

There is such a thing as a datanucleus l2 cache  that is pretty bad for hive in a distributed environment if it is set. (If there is a lone embedded hive instance  with no other codepaths to the db  then it's fine  but that never happens in a distributed environment.)By default  if no setting is present  datanucleus defaults the l2 cache to being on  so hive ups the ante by defaulting to turning it off by default if no other setting is configured.Now  in a war of 'defaults'  the hive default should win  but this is an area where we have had recurring support issues from clients that turn it on expecting improved performance. Thus  I'd like ambari installed hive-site.xml to explicitly have this config parameter turned off  with a comment asking users to not switch it on as it impacts hive negatively.The parameter in question is 'datanucleus.cache.level2.type'   and it's value should be 'none'. (Note that I've seen some older configs that seem to do things like turning datanucleus.cache.level2 = false and stuff like that  that is bogus config and does nothing and should not be assumed to be a catch-all enabler.)As a comment  I'd like the following comment 'Disables datanucleus l2 cache. This must be set to 'none' for hive to work properly' or something to that effect.,1.5.1,1.6.1,0,1,232,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0
