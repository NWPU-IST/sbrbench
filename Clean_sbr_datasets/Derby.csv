Also  this condition seems to happen only when lock escalation to table lock occurs. By increasing lock escalation threshold to prevent lock escalation and with only row level locking  the locks are released properly.I printed out the locks information and see a U row level lock on the table   and also a table level lock as a result of lock escalation. After commit  and resultset being closed  the U row level lock is not released. Thus in the second iteration of the test  the unreleased U row level lock causes a lock timeout to happen. In case of the second iteration of the test  the lock table shows the previous U row lock with a null transaction id. This is not right. The transactions are running at the default isolation level ( read committed).By default  the lock escalation threshold is set to 5000http://incubator.apache.org/derby/manuals/tuning/perf80.html#IDX547I will be attaching the program for reproduction.

For example  a NUMERIC(5 2) field with a double = 4.64 ends up with a value of 4.63 in the database. This works fine in Oracle and other databases.The problem occurs because double cannot represent 4.64 exactly  so the actual value is 4.6399999... SQLDecimal.setCoreValue uses BigDecimal(double) which constructs a BigDecimal of 4.6399999... and then SQLDecimal.setWidth uses value.setScale(desiredScale  BigDecimal.ROUND_DOWN); Note that BigDecimal javadoc recommends that the double constructor be avoided for this reason.One fix appears to be to change SQLDecimal.setCoreValue(double) to avoid using the double constructor of BigDecimal.

Space fromdeleted rows is eventually reclaimed within the file as is used forsubsequent inserts into the same file. That space is not returned tothe OS unless the user calls the SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLEsystem procedure. That procedure will return the unused space inthe tables and indexes to the OS. It gets an exclusive lock on thetable  copies all rows in the indexes and the base table into newcompressed files and delete the old files. Prior to jdk 1.4 this wasthe only way to return space from a file to the OS.In jdk 1.4 RandomAccessFile was enhanced to allow the truncation of afile  which would return the space at the 'end' of the file back tothe OS. In order to take advantage of this new feature a newcompress feature is needed in derby.The assumption is that this work will be used in future work which willautomatically schedule this job and others in background  with nointeraction needed from the dba. The 1st phase of this work willsimply build a procedure that will do the work. The 2nd phase willbe to look into scheduling the procedure automatically as part ofthe current background post commit processing. Longer term it wouldbe best if this fit into a new background task monitor  which couldschedule larger background tasks balanced against the other prioritiesof the system. These tasks might include: this new online compress automatic statistics gathering  more proactive deleted row reclamation  ....The proposed feature will reorganize base tables and indexes  movingempty pages to the 'end'. It will release space back to the operatingsystem when it has created a chunk of empty pages at the end of thefile. It will be designed to run in background  and will lock resourcesof the table for as short a time as possible so that it can iterativelyprocess the table.To reclaim space in the heap  it will scan the heap in page reverse order.It will get a short term table lock  process all the rows on a page  andthen commit that transaction releasing the lock. The commit will beoptimized like other internal transactions  and will not need to waitfor a synchonized write. Each row moved  will require all the indexentries for that row to also be updated. While doing the processing itwill also take care of processing committed deleted rows. When spaceis free at the end of the table it will be freed back to the operatingsystem  using the RandomAccessFile.setLength() interface.To reclaim space in the btree  data on pages will be moved rather thanrows. Data from pages at the end of the file will be moved to freesmaller numbered pages. Again short term table locks will be required and the operation will look similar to the current btree merge operationsalready implemented. Again when a chunk of pages is free at the end ofthe file  they will be returned to the OS using the same mechanism asthe heap.,10.1.1.0,10.1.1.0,2,1,481,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,51,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/db/OnlineCompress.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/index/B2I.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/index/B2IRowLocking1.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/index/B2IRowLocking3.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/index/B2IRowLockingRR.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/heap/Heap.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/StoredPage.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/log/CheckpointOperation.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/OnlineCompressTest.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/BaseTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/OnlineCompressTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/OnlineCompressTest_derby.properties;java/engine/org/apache/derby/catalog/SystemProcedures.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/db/OnlineCompress.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/access/GroupFetchScanController.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/access/TransactionController.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/access/conglomerate/Conglomerate.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/raw/ContainerHandle.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/raw/Page.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/DataDictionaryImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/RAMTransaction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeController.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeScan.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/index/B2I.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/conglomerate/GenericScanController.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/conglomerate/OpenConglomerate.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/conglomerate/RowPosition.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/heap/Heap.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/heap/HeapCompressScan.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/heap/HeapController.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/heap/HeapScan.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/sort/Scan.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/AllocExtent.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/AllocPage.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/BaseContainer.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/BaseContainerHandle.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/BasePage.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/FileContainer.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/InputStreamContainer.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/RAFContainer.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/StoredPage.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/onlineCompressTable.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/suites/storetests.runall;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/BaseTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/OnlineCompressTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/OnlineCompressTest_app.properties;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/OnlineCompressTest_derby.properties;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/copyfiles.ant;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/storetests/BaseTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/storetests/copyfiles.ant;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/storetests/onlineCompressTable.sql;,0,0

This was ok in the past because CONCUR_READ_ONLY was the only concurreny supported by Derby. But  now with the support of CONCUR_UPDATABLE  it is possible that the concurrency of ResultSet might not be same as the Statement object. Hence  Network Server should send the concurrency of the ResultSet object if that is what the protocol calls for.The fix for this is localized in java/drda/org/apache/derby/impl/drda/DRDAConnThread.java.,10.0.2.1,10.1.1.0,0,0,103,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,6,java/drda/org/apache/derby/impl/drda/DRDAConnThread.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNet/updatableResultSet.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNetClient/updatableResultSet.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/jdk14/updatableResultSet.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/updatableResultSet.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/updatableResultSet.java;,0,0

All other state and state related decisions should be deferred to the server.,Network client XA should only keep XA state for transaction branch association  to track whether to send commit in autocommit mode. All other state and state related decisions should be defered to the server.The client tries to track XA state to make decisions based on current XA state. Most of this state handling was removed with DERBY246  but it still was not being handled properly.

Only 'embedded' is documented in the ${DERBY_INSTALL}/demo/simple/example.html file. The others should be added. The current undocumented argument is:'jccjdbcclient' - will use the JCC client driver to access Network ServerThe new argument might be:'derbyclient' - will use the Net client driver to access Network ServerThis brief description of the program using the derby client might help in this update:To use the SimpleApp in client mode only the directory containing the SimpleApp and the netclient.jar file are needed in the CLASSPATH. By passing in 'derbyclient' as an argument the program will load the client driver rather than start the Derby engine. The parseArguments() method (line 230) changes two key strings. The variables 'driver' and 'protocol' are set to the client driver values. With these new definitions the go() method loads the client driver at line 73 and creates the client URL at lines 93-94. With the variables expanded these lines will look like this:line 76: Class.forName('org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDriver')line 93-94: conn = DriverManager.getConnection('jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/' + 'derbyDB;create=true'  props); As in the embedded example the connection will create the database if it does not exist and boot derbyDB if it has not already been loaded by the Network Server.

While the behavior of this feature is not documented yet  I think  it is desirable for IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL() function  that is used to retrieve last single statement insert value for identity column  to return user specified value for the default column.For GENERATED ALWAYS identity columns  this issue doesn't apply  since users can't provide a value. But for GENERATED BY DEFAULT identity columns  users can optionally specify a value. IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL() function should return this value. Derby currently doesn't support this behavior.ij&gt; create table tauto ( i int generated by default as identity  j int  k int);0 rows inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; insert into tauto (j k) values (1 1);1 row inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; values identity_val_local();1-------------------------------11 row selectedij&gt; insert into tauto (j k) values (1 1);1 row inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; values identity_val_local();1-------------------------------21 row selectedij&gt; insert into tauto values (5 1 1);1 row inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; values identity_val_local();1-------------------------------2 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;============= This needs be '5'1 row selectedij&gt; select * from tauto;I |J |K-----------------------------------1 |1 |12 |1 |15 |1 |13 rows selected,10.1.1.0,10.1.3.2; 10.2.1.6,0,1,160,1,16,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/InsertResultSet.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNet/autoGeneratedJdbc30.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNetClient/autoGeneratedJdbc30.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/autoGeneratedJdbc30.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/autoincrement.out;,0,0

Long varchar column doesn't allow creating indexes already.,I guess I did not articulate my reasons for suggesting removal of index support for 'long varchar for bit data' completely. 1) Long varchar types are not comparable... If they are not comparable  it should not be possible to use them in GROUP BY  ORDER BY or allow regular B-Tree indexes. 2) Also  long varchar types tend to be long in size and hence the regular B-Tree mechanism is not a suitable way to index them. Dan also mentioned they become ineffective for keys longer than half a page size.It should not be possible to create an index on 'long varchar for bit data' datatypes. Derby currently doesn't allow creating indexes on 'long varchar' datatypes and the same should apply for it's bit data equivalent too.ij&gt; create table longchar ( i int  c long varchar);0 rows inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; create index longIdx on longchar(c);ERROR X0X67: Columns of type 'LONG VARCHAR' may not be used in CREATE INDEX  ORDER BY  GROUP BY  UNION  INTERSECT  EXCEPT or DISTINCT statements because comparisons are not supported for that type.ij&gt; create table longcharBitData ( i int  c long varchar for bit data);0 rows inserted/updated/deletedij&gt; create index longIdx on longcharBitData(c);0 rows inserted/updated/deletedDerby also seems to allow GROUP BY and/or ORDER BY on LONG VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA types.

However  if I run the procedure against the Network Server using the Derby client  the holdability of all result sets is the same  and it is based on the holdability of the statement that executed the procedure--i.e. the statement-specific holdability that is defined within the procedure is ignored.Ex: If I create a stored procedure that corresponds to the following method:public static void p2(ResultSet[] rs1  ResultSet[] rs2  ResultSet[] rs3) throws Exception{ Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection( 'jdbc:default:connection'); Statement st1 = conn.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY  ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY  ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT); rs1[0] = st1.executeQuery('select * from testtable1'); Statement st2 = conn.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY  ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY  ResultSet.CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT); rs2[0] = st2.executeQuery('select * from testtable2'); Statement st3 = conn.createStatement( ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY  ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY  ResultSet.HOLD_CURSORS_OVER_COMMIT); rs3[0] = st3.executeQuery('select * from testtable3'); return; }}Then with Derby embedded  if I have a JDBC Statement that executes a call to this procedure  rs1 and rs3 will behave with HOLD_CURSORS holdability and rs2 will behave with CLOSE_CURSORS holdability--and that will be the case regardless of the holdability on the Statement that executed the call. That seems correct to me.But if I do the same thing with Network Server  all of the result sets (rs1  rs2  and rs3) will have the same holdability as the JDBC Statement that executed the call. It doesn't matter what the holdabilities used within the procedure definition are: they will all be over-ridden by the holdability of the Statement that made the call.,10.1.2.1; 10.2.1.6,10.1.2.1; 10.2.1.6,0,0,290,1,13,3,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,java/drda/org/apache/derby/impl/drda/DRDAConnThread.java;java/drda/org/apache/derby/impl/drda/DRDAStatement.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNetClient/holdCursorJava.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNetClient/xaSimplePositive.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/holdCursorJava.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/xaSimplePositive.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/xaSimplePositive.sql;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/holdCursorJava.java;,0,0

This causes the database not to be found when the classloader is URLClassLoader as the correct path for the service.properties file is db7/services.properties  not /db7/services.properties.Will add converted test (lang/dbjar.sql),10.1.1.0,10.1.2.1; 10.2.1.6,0,0,113,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,9,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/io/CPFile.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/io/CPStorageFactory.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/dbjar.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/suites/derbylang.runall;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/copyfiles.ant;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/dbjar.jar;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/dbjar.sql;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/dbjarUtil.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/dbjar_app.properties;,0,0

The materialization is done as a set of nested unions of constant rows (UnionResultSets and RowResultSets). If there are a lot of rows this can cause a stack overflow when fetching a row.The obvious fix is to make it use an iterative technique rather than a recursive one for storing and returning the rows. See the method BaseActivation.materializeResultSetIfPossible() in the language execution code.There are some other issues with this performance optimization that should be looked at:1) The optimization can backfire  making the query run much slower. For example  in the query: select * from one_row_table where column1 not in (select column2 from million_row_table)reading million_row_table into memory is an expensive operation. If there is an index on million_row_table.column2  the query should return a result very quickly despite the large size of million_row_table by doing a single probe into million_row_table via the index.Since in-memory materialization can be an expensive operation  the decision about whether to do it should be made based on query optimizer cost estimates. See SubqueryNode.generateExpression().2) It may not be wise to cache partial query results in memory at all. Although this can help performance in some cases  it also chews up memory. This is different from a limited-size cache with a backing store (like what the store uses for page caching). The language has no way to limit the total amount of memory used in this type of processing. Note that hash joins originally used in-memory hash tables with no backing store  and that a backing store was added later.3) The implementation of this optimization has some problems. The decision to materialize the subquery results in memory is made during code generation - all such decisions should be made during the compilation phase. It's not clear to me why materializeResultSetIfPossible() is in BaseActivation - I would expect the of materialization to be done by a type of ResultSet  not by a method in BaseActivation. Also  this method calls getMaxMemoryPerTable() in the OptimizerFactory - nothing in the execution code should refer to anything in the compilation code (perhaps getMaxMemoryPerTable() should be moved somewhere else).,10.1.2.1,10.2.1.6,1,0,371,1,12,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,4,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/compile/Optimizer.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/BaseActivation.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/subquery2.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/subquery2.sql;,1,9

It took 12 minutes  which is about 12 minutes more than Iexpected.After a bit of investigation  I found out that a full index scan wasperformed because all the rows referenced from the rightmost B-treenode were actually deleted.Possible improvements: 1. Implement backwards scan in the B-trees (this is also suggested in the comments in BTreeMaxScan). 2. Go up to the parent node and down to the next leaf node on the left side  and continue until a valid max value is found. In Derby  traversing up in a B-tree is not allowed  but would it be ok to go up if the latches were kept on the higher-level nodes in the tree? Of course  this would have negative impact on concurrency. 3. Right-to-left traversal on the leaf level is possible (using ControlRow.getLeftSibling())  but will throw an exception if the page cannot be latched without waiting. It is therefore possible to try a right-to-left search for the max value  and only fall back to the left-to-right approach if a conflict arises.,10.2.1.6,10.8.1.2,3,2,183,1,14,5,0,0,0,0,1,0,3,6,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeMaxScan.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeScan.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/BTreeMaxScanTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/_Suite.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/BTreeMaxScanTest.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeMaxScan.java;,0,0

The bug requires the following conditions to reproduce:1) The OS/filesystem must be case insensitive such that a request to delete a file named C2080.dat would also remove c2080.dat. This is true in windows default file systems  not true in unix/linux filesystems that I am aware of.2) The system must be shutdown not in a clean manner  such that a subsequent access of the database causes a REDO recovery action of a drop table statement. This means that a drop table statement must have happened since the last checkpoint in the log file. Examples of things that cause checkpoints are: o clean shutdown from ij using the 'exit' command o clean shutdown of database using the 'shutdown=true' url o calling the checkpoint system procedure o generating enough log activity to cause a regularly scheduled checkpoint.3) If the conglomerate number of the above described drop table is TABLE_1  then for a problem to occur there must also exist in the database a table such that it's HEX(TABLE_2) = TABLE_14) Either TABLE_2 must not be accessed during REDO prior to the REDO operation of the drop of TABLE_1 or there must be enough other table references during the REDO phase to push the caching of of the open of TABLE_2 out of cache.If all of the above conditions are met then during REDO the system willincorrectly delete TABLE_2 while trying to redo the drop of TABLE_1.&lt;p&gt;I will be adding the following test to reproduce the problem:1) create 500 tables  need enough tables to insure that conglomerate number 2080 (c820.dat) and 8320 (c2080.dat) exist.2) checkpoint the database so that create does not happen during REDO3) drop table with conglomerate number 2080  mapping to c820.dat. It looks it up in the catalog in case conglomerate number assignment changes for some reason.4) exit the database without a clean shudown  this is the default for test suites which run multiple tests in a single db - no clean shutdown is done. Since we only do a single drop since the last checkpoint  test will cause the drop during the subsequent REDO.5) run next test program dropcrash2  which will cause redo of the drop. At this point the bug will cause file c2080.dat to be incorrectly deleted and thus accesses to conglomerate 8320 will throw container does not exist errors.6) check the consistency of the database which will find the container does not exist error.,10.0.2.0; 10.1.2.1,10.0.2.2; 10.1.2.1; 10.2.1.6,0,0,410,1,7,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,0,0

But there is no way to change the next value to be generated for an identity column. Such a support in Derby will be very handy for tables with identity column defined as GENERATED BY DEFAULT and with a unique key defined on them. Column defined with GENERATED BY DEFAULT allows system to generate values for them or allows the user to manually supply the value for them. A column defined this way is very useful when the user might want to import some data into the generated column manually. But this can create problems when the system generated values conflict with manually inserted values.egautocommit on;create table tauto(i int generated by default as identity  k int); create unique index tautoInd on tauto; insert into tauto(k) values 1 2; &#8211; let system generate values for the identity column&#8211; now do few manual inserts into identity columninsert into tauto values (3 3); insert into tauto values (4 4); insert into tauto values (5 5); insert into tauto values (6 6); insert into tauto values (7 7); insert into tauto values (8 8); &#8211; notice that identity column at this point has used 1 through 8&#8211; now if the user wants to let the system generate a value  system will generate 3 but that is already used and hence&#8211; insert will throw unique key failure exception.

Basically we are running the junit tests as test type 'java'.Instead of having to do this for every junit test going into a derby test suite  I would propose a different strategy.I propose to introduce a new test type called 'junit' (current test types are: sql sql2 unit java multi demo - unit is not junit)Then you can use:java org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunTest &lt;TestCaseClassName&gt;.junitto run a Junit test - instead of:java org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.RunTest &lt;AnotherClassWithMainMethod&gt;.javaWhen starting a test of type junit  the RunTest class may simply use thejunit.textui.TestRunner class  which has a main method which takes a TestCase class name as parameter. The junit.textui.TestRunner runs the tests defined by the suite() method of the TestCase class.I think this strategy will make it easier to integrate new JUnit tests into the current test suites  since it save you the trouble of creating a java class with a main method for every test.,10.2.1.6,10.2.1.6,0,1,185,1,7,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,17,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/ScrollInsensitiveResultSet.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/harness/RunTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/harness/testtypes.properties;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNetClient/SURTest.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/SURTest.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/suites/DerbyNet.exclude;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/suites/derbynetclientmats.runall;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/suites/jdbcapi.runall;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/ConcurrencyTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/ConcurrencyTest_app.properties;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/SURBaseTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/SURDataModelSetup.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/SURQueryMixTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/SURQueryMixTest_app.properties;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/SURTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/SURTest_app.properties;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/util/TestUtil.java;,0,0

The result is that the outer query can pick an access plan that is sub-optimal.Filing this jira issue based on the thread '&#91;OPTIMIZER&#93; OptimizerImpl 'best plans' for subqueries?' from derby-dev. Description that follows is pasted from that email:http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.db.derby.devel/14836Following example of what I saw when tracing through the code demonstrates the problem.select x1.j  x2.b from (select distinct i j from t1) x1  (select distinct a b from t3) x2where x1.i = x2.a;During optimization of this query we will create three instancesof OptimizerImpl: OI_0: For 'select x1.j  x2.b from x1  x2 where x1.i = x2.a' OI_1: For 'select distinct i j from t1' OI_2: For 'select distinct a b from t3'Query ran against a clean codeline when T1 had 1 row and T3 had 50 000. &#8211; Top-level call is made to the optimize() method of the outermost SelectNode  which creates OI_0. &#8211; OI_0: picks join order {X1  X2} and calls X1.optimizeIt() &#8211; X1: creates OI_1 and makes calls to optimize it. &#8211; OI_1: picks join order {T1} and calls T1.optimizeIt() &#8211; T1: returns a cost of 20. &#8211; OI_1: saves 20 as new best cost and tells T1 to save it. &#8211; X1: calls OI_1.getOptimizedCost()  which returns 20. X1 then returns 20 to OI_0. &#8211; OI_0: calls X2.optimizeIt() &#8211; X2: creates OI_2 and makes calls to optimize it. &#8211; OI_2: picks join order {T3} and calls T3.optimizeIt() &#8211; T3: returns a cost of 64700. &#8211; OI_2: saves 64700 as new best cost and tells T3 to save it. &#8211; X2: calls OI_2.getOptimizedCost()  which returns 64700. X2 then returns 64700 to OI_0. &#8211; OI_0: saves 20 + 64700 = 64720 as new best cost and tells X1 to save 20 and X2 to save 64700. &#8211; OI_0: picks join order {X2  X1} and calls X2.optimizeIt() &#8211; X2: fetches OI_2 and makes calls to optimize it. &#8211; OI_2: picks join order {T3} and calls T3.optimizeIt() &#8211; T3: returns a cost of 10783. &#8211; OI_2: saves 10783 as new best cost and tells T3 to save it. &#8211; X2: calls OI_2.getOptimizedCost()  which returns 10783. X2 then returns 10783 to OI_0. &#8211; OI_0: calls X1.optimizeIt() &#8211; X1: fetches OI_1 and makes calls to optimize it. &#8211; OI_1: picks join order {T1} and calls T1.optimizeIt() &#8211; T1: returns a cost of 1 MILLION!. &#8211; OI_1: rejects new cost (1 mil &gt; 20) and does nothing. &#8211; X1: calls OI_1.getOptimizedCost()  which returns 20. X1 then returns 20 to OI_0...this seems WRONG! &#8211; OI_0: saves 10783 + 20 = 10803 as new best cost and tells X2 to save 10783 and X1 to save 20.So in the end  the outer-most OptimizerImpl chooses join order {X2  X1} because it thought the cost of this join order was only 10783  which is better than 64720. However  the actual cost of the join order was really estimated at 1 million--so the outer OptimizerImpl chose (and will generate) a plan that  according to the estimates  was (hugely) sub-optimal.,10.2.1.6,10.1.3.1; 10.2.1.6,0,0,518,1,7,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,2,27,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/compile/Optimizer.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/DistinctNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/FromTable.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/FromVTI.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/GroupByNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/HashTableNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/IntersectOrExceptNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/JoinNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/MaterializeResultSetNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/OptimizerImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/OrderByList.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ProjectRestrictNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ResultSetNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/RowResultSetNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/SelectNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/SingleChildResultSetNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/SubqueryNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/TableOperatorNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/UnionNode.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/derived.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/subquery.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/subquery.sql;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/access/BackingStoreHashtable.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/CostEstimateImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/FromBaseTable.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/OptimizerImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ProjectRestrictNode.java;,0,0

One suggested approach is to use the same mechanism as SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE. Suchan implementation would involve:o change the parser for alter table to accecpt some internal only syntax for SYSCS_INPLACE_COMPRESS_TABLEo change the alter table constant action to get the required information for inplace compresso move most of the inplace compress driving code to a routine in alter table execution  following the same coding pattern as existing alter table compress.I believe doing this will have multiple benefits:1) shares existing alter table code  so things like error checking  security management  ... is all done by one piece of code2) by sharing the code I believe the following outstanding JIRA issues will be addressed: DERBY-719  DERBY-720 -3) future changes addressing ddl like grant/revoke will automatically work.,10.1.3.1,10.5.1.1,0,0,168,1,29,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,7,java/engine/org/apache/derby/catalog/SystemProcedures.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/CompressTableTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/_Suite.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/GrantRevokeDDLTest.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/AlterTableNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/sqlgrammar.jj;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/AlterTableConstantAction.java;,1,1

If a bug is fixed for any of the metadata calls it can require that these queries be changed. Currently existing databases will not get updated properly if a bug is fixed. Ideally the metadata queries should match the derby version that is running. That way we avoid situations where the query is not compatible with the Derby version running.To confirm I :1) created a database with 10.1.1.02) Made a metadata change in my 10.1.2.4 client.3) Connected to the 10.1.1.0 database with 10.1.2.4 and saw that there was no change to the stored prepared statements in SYS.SYSSTATEMENTSI also confirmed that a database created with 10.1.2.4 does not get changed when reverting to 10.1.1.0.Below this line is some history and reference that might be helful to someone fixing this issue:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------In discussing DERBY-970  the subject of the metadata stored prepared statements came up.The general questions are: 1) Why do we use stored prepared statements for metadata queries?  2) What issues might there be related to upgrade/downgrade with the metadata stored prepared statements? 3) How do we address potential upgrade/downgrade issues?GENERAL HISTORY: Cloudscape 5.x had stored prepared statements  a way to store precompiledstatements in the database. This is no longer exposed externally. Metadata stored prepared statements were a performance optimization thatpredated the statement cache. In the past  this performance optimization has been of particular importanceto gui database browsers that execute all the metadata methods on connection to the database. This would still probably be an issue with embedded even with the statement cache. All stored prepared statements get recompiled on the first connection to thedatabase if the version changes.UPGRADE HISTORY In Cloudscape 5.1  the metadata stored prepared statements have traditionallybeen a source of trouble for even minor version changes as queries change or they refer to methods/stored procedures that may or may not exist in the target version and cannot recompile or execute.  The solution to the problem in Cloudscape v5.1.60 was to automaticallyalways call DD_Version.dropJDBCMetadataSPSes() whenever the version changed up or down in upgradeIfNeeded(). The workaround before this change to do this automatically was to call thismethod manually: CALL Factory.getDatabaseOfConnection(). dropAllJDBCMetaDataSPSes()HOW DERBY WORKS TODAY: In Derby we now only call dropJDBCMetadataSPSes() on fullUpgrade and it hasbeen this way since contribution. I think the problems of upgrade/downgrade for metadata stored preparedstatements may exist in Derby. I don't know a workaround to drop the metadata stored prepared statements ifwe need to deliver a bug fix or how the ugprade/downgrade is handled currently. I seem to recall some special handling in Derby for soft upgrade for optimizer directives  but don't know the details.RECENT DISCUSSIONS:In discussing DERBY-970  the subject of the metadata stored prepared statements came up.The general questions are: 1) Why do we use stored prepared statements for metadata queries?  2) What issues might there be related to upgrade/downgrade with the metadata stored prepared statements? 3) How do we address potential upgrade/downgrade issues?MY QUESTIONSAnyone know when/why the dropJDBCMetadataSPSes() on all version changes was removed between Cloudcape 5.1.60 and contribution? How do we deliver bug fixes for metadata queries or handle changes in the metadata queries in Derby?,10.0.2.0; 10.0.2.1; 10.1.1.0; 10.1.2.1; 10.1.3.1; 10.2.1.6,10.5.1.1,1,0,558,1,24,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,4,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/DataDictionary.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/DD_Version.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/DataDictionaryImpl.java;java/storeless/org/apache/derby/impl/storeless/EmptyDictionary.java;,0,0

Due to this a new implementation of PooledConnection and XAConnection for jdbc4.0 is required. According to current hierarchy XAConnection extends from PooledConnection. Going by similar hierarchy for new classes PooledConnection40 will extend from PooledConnection and XAConnection40 will be extending from PooledConnection40. This structure forces to replicate all the methods of XAConnection to be present in XAConnection40 too. In the current implementation EmbedXAConnection itself is XAResource.

I want to avoidthe log as it also is encrypted. Here is my VERY high level plan:1) Force exclusive access by putting all the work in the low level store  offline boot method. We will do redo recovery as usual  but at the end there will be an entry point to do the copy/encrypt operation.copy/encrypt process:0) The request to encrypt/re-encrypt the db will be handled with a new set of url flags passed into store at boot time. The new flags will provide the same inputs as the current encrypt flags. So at high level the request will be 'connect db old_encrypt_url_flags; new_encrypt_url_flags'. TODO - provide exact new flag syntax.1) Open a transaction do all logged work to do the encryption. All logging will be done with existing encryption.2) Copy and encrypt every db file in the database. The target files will be in the data directory. There will be a new suffix to track the new files  similar to the current process used for handling drop table in a transaction consistent manner without logging the entire table to the log. Entire encrypted destination file is guaranteed synced to disk before transaction commits. I don't think this part needs to be logged. Files will be read from the cache using existing mechanism and written directly into new encrypted files (new encrypted data does not end up in the cache).3) Switch encrypted files for old files. Do this under a new log operation so the process can be correctly rolled back if the encrypt db operation transaction fails. Rollback will do file at a time switches  no reading of encrypted data is necessary.4) log a 'change encryption of db' log record  but do not update system.properties with the change.5) commit transaction.6) update system.properties and sync changes.7) TODO - need someway to handle crash between steps 5 and 6.6) checkpoint all data  at this point guaranteed that there is no outstanding transaction  so after checkpoint is done there is no need for the log.ISSUES:o there probably should be something that catches a request to encrypt to whatever db was already encrypted

I would appreciate any help in figuring this out. =)The problem is a NullPointerException in the Network Server when it tries to initialize the LDAP authentication service. The attached derby.log shows the exception and its stacktrace. The attached derby.properties is what I put in the derby home directory.I'm seeing this problem in the trunk as well as my own build of the 10.1 branch and the 10.1.2.1 release build available from the Derby web site. ( http://db.apache.org/derby/releases/release-10.1.2.1.cgi )The problem is cause by the setInitDirContextEnv method in JNDIAuthenticationSchemeBase receiving a null dbProps argument  which it obviously doesn't expect. Adding a check for a null dbProps argument and returning immediately after creating the initDirContextEnv object fixes the NullPointerException and makes LDAP authentication work for me. This is a reasonable enough robustness fix and shouldn't have any negative impact  but if the source of the problem is that JNDIAuthenticationSchemeBase should never receive that null pointer in the first place  more patching is needed. I'm not sure about this  so I'm leaving it up to the experts to decide this. =),10.1.2.1; 10.2.1.6,10.1.3.1; 10.2.1.6,0,0,233,1,11,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/authentication/JNDIAuthenticationSchemeBase.java;,0,0

Please note: I have marked this as a Regression Test Failure although this test has not passed with IBM 1.5 JVM atleast in our nightly regression test runs  so it is not a regression of the product. diff:                 Diff file derbyall/derbylang/procedure.diff             Start: procedure jdk1.5.0 derbyall:derbylang 2006-05-10 22:17:16 ***1018 del&lt; testImplicitClose(): PASSED1018 add&gt; testImplicitClose(): FAILED (no exception thrown)Test Failed.

The problem seems to be in EmbedXAResource. So it happens with both embedded and client driver. Client driver internally uses SQL to set the transaction isolation. So the problem is more likely to be hit with the client.

The following must be true for the bug to occur:  There must be more data in the stream than what can fit into the initial buffer (32 K). The method 'available' of the stream returns 0.Since the default return value for 'InputStream.available' is 0  and the method reading the stream can be used for data types CHAR FOR BIT DATA  VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA and LONG VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA  the bug should be fixed. The maximum length is 32700 bytes.The method will also be used by SQLBlob  but it may be better to introduce a new streaming method for it  since the current implementation has memory-problems for large data (materializes the whole stream). A separate issue should/will be created for this.The symptom for this bug is a hang when calling one of the execute methods of Prepared- or CallableStatement and maybe also certain set methods in ResultSet.The visibility of this bug is very low  but the impact is severe/critical.

The current problem is as following:If user already has a CLASSPATH set on their system  the CLASSPATH is not set again within the script. Therefore  there are no derby classes in the CLASSPATH which results in java command failing as it can not find the derby class it is calling. Basically  to make the scripts work  user has to either issue command 'set CLASSPATH=' or have derby jar files be appended to their system CLASSPATH before running any frameworks batch script.In ksh scripts  there is same problem except that the user has to issue command 'export CLASSPATH=' or have derby jar files be appended to their system CLASSPATH only once as whatever CLASSPATH is set up by scripts is not visible once the script is done.So I am proposing the following solution so that frameworks scripts work properly without interfering with system classpath or without any setup from user.In batch scripts:-----------------------1. Before line 'call '%DERBY_INSTALL%'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.bat'  save the current classpath as follows:set SAVED_CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%2. Replace the following lines:@if Unable to render embedded object: File (&quot;%CLASSPATH%&quot;==) not found. call '%DERBY_INSTALL%'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.bat@if '%CLASSPATH%' == '' call '%DERBY_INSTALL%'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.batwithcall '%DERBY_INSTALL%'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.batNote: I have given the above as example only. The name of script that is getting called may be different.3. At the end of script  reset the CLASSPATH to system CLASSPATH as follows:set CLASSPATH=%SAVED_CLASSPATH%In korn scripts:-----------------------In ksh script  even though system classpath is only modified within the script and is not effective once script exits  to be consistent with batch scripts  do the following:1. Before line '. '$DERBY_HOME'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.ksh' save the current classpath as follows:export SAVED_CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH2. Replace the following lines:[ -z '$CLASSPATH' ] &amp;&amp; { . '$DERBY_HOME'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.ksh}with. '$DERBY_HOME'/frameworks/embedded/bin/setEmbeddedCP.kshNote: I have given the above as example only. The name of script that is getting called may be different.3.

Embretsen,2006/08/08 04:16:35 +0100,7.604282407,7.604282407,Test harness overrides heap size settings when starting Network Server,Test specific heap size settings can be passed to the test harness using the jvmflags system property  for example in a &lt;testname&gt;_app.properties file or at the command line when starting a test  e.g '-Djvmflags=-Xms32m^-Xmx32m'.The test harness almost always overrides such settings when starting a new Network Server using the org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.harness.NetServer class of the test harness. Currently  if either -ms or -Xms is missing from the jvmflags  NetServer.start() adds -ms16777216. Also  if either -mx or -Xmx is missing from the jvmflags  NetServer.start() adds -ms33554432. This has been the case since SVN revision 420048 (July 8  2006).Earlier revisions did not override the heap settings unless the newer -Xms or -Xmx flags were used instead of the -ms and -mx flags. A patch for DERBY-1091 attempted (among other things) to make the harness recognize the newer flags as well as the older flags  but the resulting behavior is (most likely) not as intended. If a test is run in either the DerbyNet framework or the DerbyNetClient framework  the test-specific JVM flags should (probably) be used for the Network Server JVM as well as the test JVM. Currently  even if non-default heap size flags are passed to the harness  the server JVM will ignore these settings since the harness adds -ms and/or -mx flags after all other heap flags.

Sequences of atomic values will not have spaces between  but the space is required as part of step 3 of the normalization rules at the above link. 2. Derby will allow serialization of a sequence even if it has a top-level Attribute node in it  but the rules of normalization dictate that an error should be thrown instead (step 7).Both of these behaviors can be seen with the following query.values xmlserialize( xmlquery('/ageinfo/@*' passing by ref xmlparse( document '&lt;ageinfo age='48' birthdate='1900-02-08'/&gt;' preserve whitespace ) empty on empty ) as char(50) )Derby will currently return the following result from this statement:1--------------------------------------------------481900-02-08This result does not abide by SQL/XML specification because a) Derby allowed serialization of a sequence having a top-level attribute node (actually  the sequence had two)  and b) the atomic values produced from the attributes were displayed without a space between them.The correct behavior for the above example is to return a serialization error caused by the presence of an Attribute node in the sequence.If the example was rewritten as  say: xmlquery('/ageinfo/@*' passing by ref+ xmlquery('fn:data(/ageinfo/@*)' passing by refthen the attribute nodes are no longer present--we only have their atomic values  which is allowed. Thus the correct result should then be:1--------------------------------------------------48 1900-02-08Note  though  that Xalan doesn't appear to support the 'fn:data' function  so this rewritten query won't actually work. I tried using Xalan's built-in string function  as follows: xmlquery('/ageinfo/@*' passing by ref+ xmlquery('string(/ageinfo/@*)' passing by refbut Xalan only returns the first attribute in that case; it doesn't return the second one. So part of this Jira issue is probably going to involve figuring out how to allow a user to retrieve a sequence of attribute values (as opposed to attribute nodes) using Xalan and still abide by the SQL/XML rules.,10.2.1.6; 10.2.2.0; 10.3.1.4,10.2.2.0; 10.3.1.4,0,0,350,1,7,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,9,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/SqlXmlUtil.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/XML.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/XMLDataValue.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages_en.properties;java/shared/org/apache/derby/shared/common/reference/SQLState.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNet/xml_general.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNetClient/xml_general.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/xml_general.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/xml_general.sql;,0,0

The actual bug described in DERBY-1777 is an NPE  and that's what the patch for DERBY-1777 addresses.However  once the NPEs are fixed  some of the queries in that same program now fail with ASSERT failures when running in SANE mode; this Jira issue is for addressing those assert failures.While this does constitute a regression  I don't know yet what the root cause of the problem is  so I hesitate to make it a 10.2 blocker--hence urgency is 'Normal'. I'm still investigating the queries to try to track down where the problem is  but all I've been able to deduce so far is that a) the assertion occurs for a scoped predicate and thus the pushing of join predicates into UNIONs is somehow involved  and b) in INSANE mode the query compiles without problem and appears (based on some early and very incomplete testing) to execute without problem. But more investigation is required to determine if the execution/results are actually correct  and to understand more about why the assertion is being thrown.I'm marking the fixin as 10.2.2.0 for now since I don't enough to make this a blocker for 10.2.1.

The TPC-C specification is used mainly forthe database schema &amp; population rules and the logic of the business transactions.http://www.tpc.org/tpcc/OE is set up so that the driving &amp; display of the business transactions is separated from the actual implementation which then allows different implementations to compare performance of Derby features. In all cases the implementationswould perform the logical functionality required by the TPC-C  but need not be strict implementations. As an examplethe new order number is obtained in a defined way in TPC-C  but Derby could use generated keys to perform thesame logical function. Testing the two ways would lead to see if there were performance problems with generated keys.Examples of the possible implementations of the business transactions are: direct - client executes SQL statements directly holding onto PreparedStatements for the lifetime of the client) procedure - client executes a procedure per business transaction EOD - implementation using JDBC 4^H5? EOD updateable ResultSets positioned updates etc.Other options include use of triggers use of generated keys etc.Possible values for the display (results of the transaction) nothing text HTML for servlets/JSPs etc.Also the loading of the data could support different options: load with/without contraints in place load using INSERT statements load using import load using import with a ResultSet class.OE allows the amount of data loaded initially to be varied very easily  just by setting the warehousescale factor  so a warehouse=1 creates a database of size N  and warehouse=100 a database of size 100N (roughly).This allows databases in the range 10-100Gb to be easily created.The general setup would that OE could be used as a function test  performance test  or stress test so it's seen as a toolkit.I hope also that the OE could be expanded beyond the TPC-C spec  for example: adding images (BLOBs) and descriptions (CLOBs) to the product ITEM table. adding triggers to send-email on various actions.These additions would be intended to test Derby functionality in a 'real-world' OLTP application.The top-level package under java/testing would be org.apache.derbyTesting.systemTests.oe,10.6.1.0,10.6.1.0,0,0,360,0,3,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,3,java/testing/build.xml;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/system/oe/build.xml;tools/ant/properties/dirs.properties;,0,0

This was probably done to mimic the behaviour ofEmbedSQLException  which overrides printStackTrace() to achieve thesame. Later  code was added to ferry arguments over DRDA. This code createda dummy exception which the old code interpreted as a non-SQLExceptionwhose stack trace should be used for the main exception. Therefore  allexceptions now have the same stack trace as the dummy exception created inwrapArgsForTransportAcrossDRDA().I think the best solution is not to set the stack trace explicitly  noteven when the SQLException is caused by a non-SQLException.EmbedSQLException overrides printStackTrace() because throwables in Java1.3 didn't have initCause()/getCause()  so it was the only way to preservethe original stack trace. Since the SQLExceptions in JDBC 4.0 haveinitCause()/getCause()  there is no reason why the JDBC4 driver shouldmimic EmbedSQLException's workaround for not having these methods.,10.2.1.6,10.2.2.0; 10.3.1.4,0,0,165,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,3,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/SQLExceptionFactory40.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/jdk16/closed.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/jdk16/releaseCompileLocks.out;,0,0

These checks appear to be there to detect error conditions  so it seems more appropriate to make them ASSERTs. Especially since they are so expensive.DTrace analysis seems to confirm that these methods get called very frequently:Knut Anders Hatlen wrote the following in a message on derby-dev:FYI  I just ran the DERBY-1961 test clients and traced them with aDTrace script that printed how often each method was called. For thejoin client  ArrayInputStream.setPosition() was the most frequentlycalled method (43837.7 calls/tx). For the single-record select client it was third (58.4 calls/tx)  only beaten by Object.&lt;init&gt;() andDDMWriter.ensureLength(). I think this means that setPosition() is theengine method that is most frequently called  at least in read-mostlytransactions. ArrayInputStream.setLimit() also appeared near the topof the list.

The differences are minimal. However  I want to be able to still run with the old (except where the results differ  failures would occur with the old version).One of the reasons for moving to the new version is that there is a bug with the older version in regards to security manager  preventing a smooth run of the junit tests  and I'd like to run all short-running tests (suites.All and derbyall) with at least one of the versions.

Actually filling in this template is a time-consuming  error-prone process. We would like to automate this process as much as possible. We believe it ought to be possible to generate the Release Notes given the following inputs:1) A high-level description of the release. The Release Manager would write this description  based on a template.2) An xml report produced by a JIRA filter. The filter would list all of the JIRAs addressed by the release.In order for this to work  we would need for the community to agree on conventions for the release notes which are attached to JIRAs  viz.  the JIRAs whose 'Release Note Needed' toggles are turned on. These JIRA-specific notes become items in the Issues section of the final Release Notes. Each of these items calls the reader's attention to a significant topic involving Derby's behavior  that behavior's compatibility with previous releases  and adjustments which the user may need to make to her applications.The following approach makes sense to us:A) The community will agree on an html template for these notes.B) The note-writer will fill in this template and attach it to the JIRA using a canonical file name  say 'releaseNote.html'.C) Various iterations of the note may be needed.D) The utility for generating Release Notes will grab the latest rev of 'releaseNote.html' attached to the JIRA.This effort involves at least two major steps:I) Getting the community to agree to these note-writing conventions.II) Writing the Release Note generator.,10.3.1.4,10.3.1.4,0,0,271,1,36,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,18,java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/ReleaseNotesGenerator.java;java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/ReleaseNoteReader.java;java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/ReleaseNotesGenerator.java;RELEASE-NOTES.html;java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/ReleaseNotesGenerator.java;releaseSummary.xml;tools/release/build.xml;tools/release/templates/releaseSummaryTemplate.xml;java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/JiraConnector.java;java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/ReleaseNotesGenerator.java;tools/release/templates/releaseSummaryTemplate.xml;java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/ReleaseNoteReader.java;java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/ReleaseNotesGenerator.java;tools/release/templates/releaseNote.html;CHANGES;releaseSummary.xml;RELEASE-NOTES.html;java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/ReleaseNotesGenerator.java;,0,0

It would be useful if any errors included the parameters as well as the statement text.To reproduce put derby.stream.error.logSeverityLevel=0 in your derby.properties and run this script: connect 'jdbc:derby:wombat;create=true';create table t (i int);prepare p as 'insert into t values'; execute p using 'values(1)';execute p using 'values(10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)';,10.3.1.4,10.1.3.2; 10.2.2.1; 10.3.1.4,0,0,96,1,6,4,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/conn/GenericStatementContext.java;,0,0

In the five former methods  SqlExceptions are thrown if tablename == null  but this check is not performed in the latter two.The method calls eventually end up in EmbedDatabaseMetaData  which performs this check. Hence  an exception is thrown either way. If we want the exception to be thrown as early as possible  the two latter methods should do so as well. If not  the check should be removed from the former methods.,10.3.1.4,10.3.1.4; 10.4.1.3,0,0,90,1,5,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/DatabaseMetaData.java;,0,0

I'll append exact tests as a comment on this issue.To debug the problem I picked one - org.apache.derbyTesting.functionTests.tests.derbynet.NSSecurityMechanismTest and ran it in a loop. When I did this it failed everytime after the first one (and the first one intermittently failed). When I bumped the WAIT_TIME up to 300000 and the SLEEP_TIME to 500 injava/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/NetworkServerTestSetup.java then the test passed everytime .

Connection.prepareStatement(String sql  int autoGeneratedKeys); Statement.execute(String sql  int autoGeneratedKeys); Statement.executeUpdate(String sql  int autoGeneratedKeys); // Retrieve the auto-generated values (only applies to INSERT statements). ResultSet rs = Statement.getGeneratedKeys();The current implementation of getGeneratedKeys() internally maps to the 'IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL()' method  which means that Derby's implementation only returns generated keys for autoincrement columns (no other default columns are supported). Further: 1. The generated key result set only ever has a single column. This is because Derby only allows one autoincrement column per table. 2. The type of the single column in the result set will be DECIMAL(31 0). This is defined by IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL(). 3. The generated key result set will only ever have a single row. This is because IDENTITY_VAL_LOCAL() only returns values that were assigned as the result of a single row INSERT statement using a VALUES clause. For a single row INSERT statement  at most one autoincrement value will be generated.All of that said  JDBC 3.0 also defines the following methods  which allow the user to explicitly indicate  via column position or column name  the columns for which the auto-generated keys should be made available: Connection.prepareStatement(String sql  String[] columnNames); Connection.prepareStatement(String sql  int[] columnIndexes); Statement.execute(String sql  String[] columNames); Statement.execute(String sql  int[] columIndexes); Statement.executeUpdate(String sql  String[] columnNames); Statement.executeUpdate(String sql  int[] columnIndexes);Derby currently throws a 'Feature not supported' error for all of these methods. However  it seems like the above methods could be 'mapped' onto the existing Derby behavior with relatively little effort (in embedded mode). Most of the required code is already in place.Doing so would make it easier for applications that rely on the columnNames and/or columnIndexes APIs to work with Derby (assuming the app just wants generated keys for identity (autoincrement) columns).Note that this Jira does not entail removing any of the restrictions nor changing any of the behavior outlined above. All of that will remain exactly as it is. This Jira simply exposes the existing functionality (restrictions and all) through additional (standard) API methods. In particular this means that any column specified by index (position) or name must be an auto-increment column for the INSERT table; otherwise Derby should throw an error.

Instead of writing methods that forwards calls to the underlying InternalClob  the method getInternalClob will return the internal clob itself. This seems more in place  since the method getByteLength does not belong in EmbedClob. It also comes with a warning that using the reference to the internal clob object requires the caller to take more care. Second  isWritable() does not belong to EmbedClob either  as a Clob is always writable (unless the database/connection itself is read/only). However  the internal clob representation may be read-only  in case EmbedClob must clone the content and create a writable representation.The fix leaves more of the handling of implementation details to the InternalClob itself.,10.3.1.4,10.3.1.4,0,0,165,1,3,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,2,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/ClobUpdateableReader.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/EmbedClob.java;,0,0

This might also lead to deleting one helper method for generating an exception (the one with no message). Improve error reporting for trying to use the reader after it has been closed (currently an IOException with no message). Remove trailing spaces  and add a few newlines here and there. Replace tabs in the file with spaces.Now  the last point can be discussed  but here are my arguments for doing it: The file now has a mix of tabs and spaces (but still more tabs). Spaces are the preferred/required method of indentation. I want to get it fixed before the branch is cut  which makes it easier to port fixes from trunk/10.3-NEXT to 10.3. If I don't make it for 10.3  I won't do it. I don't see it as very likely that we will back-port major fixes to this class on the 10.2 branch.

For instance  Anders Morken wrote this in a comment on DERBY-1704: 'With a separate table and index for each thread (to remove latch contention and lock waits from the equation) we (...) found that org.apache.derby.impl.services.cache.Clock.find()/release() caused about 5 times more contention than the synchronization in LockSet.lockObject() and LockSet.unlock(). That might be an indicator of where to apply the next push'.It would be interesting to see the scalability and performance of a buffer manager which exploits the concurrency utilities added in Java SE 5.,10.4.1.3,10.4.1.3,1,1,109,1,80,9,0,0,0,0,1,0,23,57,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/CacheEntry.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ClockPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ClockPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ReplacementPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/BackgroundCleaner.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ClockPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ClockPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ReplacementPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/CacheEntry.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ClockPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ClockPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/cache/CacheManager.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/build.xml;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/BackgroundCleaner.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/CacheEntry.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ClockPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ClockPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/cache/CacheFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/cache/CacheManager.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/access/TransactionController.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/raw/Transaction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/raw/data/DataFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/raw/xact/RawTransaction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/RAMTransaction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/BaseDataFileFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/xact/Xact.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/build.xml;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/CacheEntry.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCacheFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/build.xml;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/CacheEntry.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ClockPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCacheFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ReplacementPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/CacheEntry.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/modules.properties;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/cache/CacheManager.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ClockPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ClockPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCacheFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/BackgroundCleaner.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ClockPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ReplacementPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/cache/ConcurrentCache.java;,0,0

Satoor,2007/09/05 06:53:41 +0100,49.46490741,6.538472222,In soft upgrade mode  the metadata queries do not get compiled in SYS schema. This will cause problems in future releases of Derby.,EmbedDatabaseMetaData implements metadata queries. The implementation of metadata queries in EmbedDatabaseMetaData checks if we are in soft upgrade mode (getPreparedQuery() has following code)if (notInSoftUpgradeMode()) s = getPreparedQueryUsingSystemTables(queryName  net);else { try { //Can't use stored prepared statements because we are in soft upgrade //mode and hence need to get metadata sql from metadata.properties file //or metadata_net.properties String queryText = getQueryFromDescription(queryName  net); s = getEmbedConnection().prepareMetaDataStatement(queryText); } catch (Throwable t) { throw handleException(t); } }So  when running in soft upgrade mode  we do not go through SYSSTATEMENT but this will cause the metadata query to run in whatever the current schema may be rather than in SYS schema. This is not a problem in Derby 10.3 release because during soft upgarde  the collation will always be UCS_BASIC and hence collation mismatch can't happen.But in Derby 10.3  a user can create a database with territory based collation. When such a database will be in soft upgrade mode for say Derby 10.4  the metadata queries will run into problem if they are run in a user schema. This is because in soft upgrade mode  we do not go through SYSSTATEMENTS and instead compile the metadata queries in current schema. If the current schema is user schema  then character string literals in metadata queries will get the collation type of territory based and when compared with character string colunms from SYS tables with collation type of UCS_BASIC  we will end up getting compilation error for the metadata queries. So  before the next release  we will have to fix this problem. One solution may be to somehow make the current compilation schema as SYS when running the metadata queries in soft upgrade mode.,10.4.1.3,10.4.1.3,1,0,276,1,5,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,4,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/conn/GenericLanguageConnectionContext.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/Changes10_4.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/UpgradeRun.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/_Suite.java;,0,0

I was wondering if someone that knows the code can give me a few pointers on the implications of this issue: Is this a limitation of the top-down algorithm used? Would fixing it require to use a bottom up algorithm for better concurrency (which is certainly non trivial)? Trying to break the circular locking above  I would first question why does the select transaction need to acquire (and hold) a lock on the root block of the index. Would it be possible to ensure the consistency of the select without locking the index?The attached test (InsertSelectDeadlock.java) tries to simulate a typical data collection application  it consists of:  an insert thread that inserts records in batch a select thread that 'processes' the records inserted by the other thread: 'select * from table where id &gt; ?'The derby log provides detail about the deadlock trace and stacktraces_during_deadlock.txt shows that the inser thread is doing an index split.The test was run on 10.2.2.0 and 10.3.1.4 with identical behaviour.Thanks Bogdan Calmac.,10.2.2.0; 10.3.1.4; 10.4.2.0,10.5.1.1,13,10,348,1,79,13,0,0,0,1,0,0,8,40,java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/_Suite.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/IndexSplitDeadlockTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/IndexSplitDeadlockTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/_Suite.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/IndexSplitDeadlockTest.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/access/conglomerate/ScanManager.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/access/conglomerate/TransactionManager.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/raw/Page.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/raw/RecordHandle.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/RAMTransaction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeController.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeForwardScan.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeLockingPolicy.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeMaxScan.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreePostCommit.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeRowPosition.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeScan.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/LeafControlRow.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/OpenBTree.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/index/B2INoLocking.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/index/B2IRowLocking1.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/index/B2IRowLocking2.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/index/B2IRowLocking3.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/index/B2IRowLockingRR.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/heap/HeapRowLocation.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/heap/HeapScan.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/sort/Scan.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/BasePage.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/RowLockIso.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/readlocks.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/rlliso2multi.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/rlliso3multi.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/updatelocksJDBC30.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/rlliso2multi.sql;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/rlliso3multi.sql;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/unitTests/store/T_RawStoreFactory.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/unitTests/store/T_b2i.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/IndexSplitDeadlockTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/perf/basic/jdbc/IndexScanTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/IndexSplitDeadlockTest.java;,0,0

It would be nice if Derby let you invoke a function bound to a method with a variable length argument list. The Reference Guide states a small number of restrictions for methods which can be invoked as Derby functions: They must be public  static  and not have arguments which are long datatypes. I see no reason that Derby shouldn't be able to resolve and invoke functions which are bound to methods which don't suffer these limitations but which have variable argument lists.,10.0.2.0; 10.0.2.1; 10.1.1.0; 10.1.2.1; 10.1.3.1; 10.2.1.6; 10.2.2.0; 10.3.1.4,10.10.1.1,0,2,88,1,46,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,8,38,java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/VarargsRoutines.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/loader/ClassInspector.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/loader/Java5ClassInspector.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/DataDictionaryImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/MethodCallNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/NewInvocationNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/StaticMethodCallNode.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/VarargsRoutines.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/VarargsTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/build.xml;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/Changes10_10.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/loader/ClassInspector.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/MethodCallNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/StaticMethodCallNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/loader/ClassInspector.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/MethodCallNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/StaticMethodCallNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/sqlgrammar.jj;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/VarargsRoutines.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/VarargsTest.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/MethodCallNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/StaticMethodCallNode.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/VarargsRoutines.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/VarargsTest.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/catalog/types/RoutineAliasInfo.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/DataDictionaryImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/CreateAliasNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/sqlgrammar.jj;java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages.xml;java/shared/org/apache/derby/shared/common/reference/SQLState.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNetClient/dblook_test_net.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNetClient/dblook_test_net_territory.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/dblook_test.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/dblook_test_territory.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/VarargsTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/_Suite.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/tools/dblook_makeDB.sql;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/Changes10_10.java;,0,0

Adams,2007/10/26 02:20:23 +0100,27.16625,5.473368056,Intermittent transaction failure caused by internal duplicate savepoint name for triggers,While running our app overnight  performing some intensive database operations (primarily deletes)  we experienced a transaction failure  with error message 'A SAVEPOINT with the passed name already exists in the current transaction'. This failure appears to be very intermittent  as I've run the same operation successfully for hours and hours without failure. Some more information:1. I see that there are four JIRA issues which report the same message (DERBY-2773  DERBY-1457  DERBY-2808  DERBY-2804). I am not sure to what extent if any  the problem I experienced is related to these issues. At least three of the above JIRA issues are related to triggers. Our transaction failure occurred while performing a delete in a table which has delete triggers. We aren't using savepoints explicitly. Of course  it can be seen in the stack trace that the trigger operation is setting a savepoint. One of the JIRA issues mentions exceeding maximum depth of nested triggers. Not sure what a nested trigger is  but the trigger we are performing should not (in theory) cause another trigger event.2.

Here are the relevant tables and triggers. We have different tables for different 'sample' data types in our application (currently int  long  float  double  Boolean  string). I have shown the int_sample table; the other tables are identical but have a different data type for the value field. Sample records are first class; time records are second class - they only exist to support sample records. When there are no remaining sample records for a given time record  the time record can be removed. It is the job of the trigger to perform this cleanup: when a record is deleted from any of the sample tables  the time record corresponding to *_sample.fk_time_id is deleted only if there are no remaining records in any of the sample tables which have the same fk_time_id. So although there are cascading deletes (deleting a time record deletes all of its samples)  the trigger should not recurse because the trigger only deletes when there are no associated records.create table time ( id int not null generated always as identity  time timestamp not null  constraint time_pk primary key (id)  constraint time_unique unique (time));create table int_sample ( fk_band_id int not null  fk_time_id int not null  value int not null  constraint int_sample_pk primary key (fk_band_id  fk_time_id)  constraint int_sample_fk_band foreign key (fk_band_id) references band (id) on delete cascade  constraint int_sample_fk_time foreign key (fk_time_id) references time (id) on delete cascade);create trigger cascade_delete_unused_time_for_int_sample_trigger after delete on int_sample referencing old as oldrow for each row delete from time where  time.id = oldrow.fk_time_id and id not in (select fk_time_id from int_sample)  and id not in (select fk_time_id from long_sample)  and id not in (select fk_time_id from float_sample)  and id not in (select fk_time_id from double_sample)  and id not in (select fk_time_id from boolean_sample)  and id not in (select fk_time_id from string_sample);4. Invocation. This is very rough pseudocode focusing on the core logic. In reality  there's a lot more code  but I'm doing the usual stuff  such as using prepared statements  and closing all resources when done. The key thing is that I'm using two statements in a nested fashion; in the outer statement  I iterate over records in the time table  and in the inner loop I use a second statement to delete records in one of the sample tables.

It is initialized in StoredPage.initSpace() which is again called from StoredPage.usePageBuffer()  and it is set to the value returned from AllocPage.getMaxFreeSpace(). The problems are: 1) The calculation in getMaxFreeSpace() uses borrowedSpace  but when createIdentity() is called on an AllocPage  borrowedSpace has not been initialized when getMaxFreeSpace() is called and the calculated size is wrong. 2) When a page object is reused  usePageBuffer() is only called if a new byte array must be allocated (because the new page has a different size than the old page). This means that the totalSize field gets the same value as in the old page if their sizes are equal  which is not necessarily correct.,10.4.1.3,10.4.1.3; 10.5.1.1,0,0,121,1,7,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/AllocPage.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/CachedPage.java;,0,0

The existing instance variables are not used.With this planned change  you can run tests without including derbynet.jar on the classpath  as long as they don't call 'startNetworkServer' or 'stopNetworkServer'.

Since DERBY-3187 fixes this by removing Java ME support from SimpleApp  a separate simple demo for Java ME should be included along with the other demos available in Derby distributions.Currently supported Java ME platforms are Java ME Virtual Machines with Connected Device Configuration (CDC) support and the Foundation Profile 1.1 or better  with the optional package for JDBC (JSR-169).The new demo should be easy to use and understand  and should be well commented. The demo code should demonstrate how to create and connect to a Derby database in a valid Java ME environment  and perform some basic database operations (insert  update  query). A readme file describing the demo (and instructions for building and running it) should be included.,10.4.1.3,10.3.2.1; 10.4.1.3,0,0,166,1,6,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,10,java/demo/simplemobile/SimpleMobileApp.java;java/demo/simplemobile/readme.html;java/demo/simplemobile/readme.html;java/demo/build.xml;java/demo/csfull.css;java/demo/demo.html;java/demo/navbar.html;java/demo/simplemobile/SimpleMobileApp.java;java/demo/simplemobile/readme.html;tools/release/build.xml;,0,0

For details see: http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/JoinOrderPermutationsAs optimizables are added to the join order the optimizer keeps track of the accumulated cost estimate for the join order. Then when an Optimizable is removed ('pulled') from the join order  the optimizer substracts that Optimizable's cost from the total accumulated cost.In certain cases (esp. with very large queries) it's possible that the cost for some Optimizable OPT_A is so large that adding it to the accumulated cost of the join order leads to loss of the previous sum. This happens due to normal Java addition of double values  see 'doubleAdd.java' attached.As an example  assume our current join order is: { OPT_0  OPT_1  -- }and that the estimated costs for OPT_0 and OPT_1 are 700 and 800  respectively. The accumulated cost for OPT_0 and OPT_1 is then 700 + 800 = 1500. Then assume we place OPT_A into the final position in the join order: { OPT_0  OPT_1  OPT_A }If the cost of OPT_A is something that is orders of magnitude larger than 1500  then by adding it to 1500 we will effectively 'lose' the 1500. Let's say the cost of OPT_A is estimated to be 3.14E50 (which is actually possible  esp. as a result of DERBY-1905). The size of OPT_A's cost makes the cost of OPT_0 + OPT_1 insignificant when using Java doubles (see attached doubleAdd.java): 1500 + 3.14E50 = 3.14E50So the total accumulated cost for the join order is now 3.14E50. Later  when we go to pull OPT_A from the join order  we'll subtract its cost from the accumulated cost  yielding: 3.14E50 - 3.14E50 = 0Notice how the accumulated cost  which is supposed to represent the cost of OPT_0 plus the cost of OPT_1  is now ZERO. And our join order goes back to: { OPT_0  OPT_1  -- }Next we pull OPT_1 from the join order  which means we have to subtract it's cost from the accumulated cost: 0 - 800 = -800So we end up with a negative accumulated cost  which is WRONG. (Actually  the ZERO accumulated cost in the previous step was wrong; this is just a side effect).As it turns out  there is code in OptimizerImpl that tries to account for negative costs when the negative value comes from normal imprecise arithmetic. In particular we see the following in the code that pulls Optimizables: double newCost = currentCost.getEstimatedCost(); if (pullCostEstimate != null) { pullCost = pullCostEstimate.getEstimatedCost(); newCost -= pullCost; /* ** It's possible for newCost to go negative here due to ** loss of precision. */ if (newCost &lt; 0.0) newCost = 0.0; ... }This code hides the error mentioned above because when it sees '-800' it assumes that the negative stems from normal loss of precision. So the cost for the plan is incorrectly set to '0'  which makes it cheaper than any other plan thus far (and probably cheaper than anything to come)  and therefore the optimizer will probably choose the wrong plan.I think the check for negative newCost is only valid if the join position that we're pulling is 0-i.e. if we just pulled the first optimizable in the join order. In that case the accumulated cost should be zero  so checking for a negative value and setting it to zero is fine-we're just accounting for the loss of precision that is mentioned in the current code comments.Note that the same issue also exists for 'sort avoidance costs'  but in that code there is (currently) no check for negative costs. So if a situation as described above occurs in the current code when the cost of OPT_A is for a sort avoidance plan  the code will throw an ASSERTION failure because the cost should be non-negative.I noticed this behavior somewhat accidentally while testing out a fix for DERBY-3023: with my attempted fix applied  the query 'new-style-sql.txt' was failing with an ASSERTION failure due to the negative cost estimate.

But as soon as I use the derby network client to access the database  this problem occurs.This is very odd. I spent a lot of time to do some research on this behavior because I could not believe that the network client produces errors depending on the data contained in a table. But after all it looks like I managed to fill the table with an exact amount of data that causes this error to arise.To reproduce the problem download the attached file and follow these instructions: extract test.rar to $derby.system.home$ start derby network server start ji utility and execute the following commands:  connect to database test using client driver: connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost/test;user=ZOL;password=zol'; select content of table PCLASS select * from PCLASS;--&gt; Error XN008: Query processing has been terminated due to an error on the server      disconnect from database disconnect; shutdown database 'test' connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost/test;user=ZOL;password=zol;shutdown=true'; connect to database 'test' using embedded driver: connect 'jdbc:derby:test;user=ZOL;password=zol'; select content of table PCLASS select * from PCLASS;--&gt; everything o.k.,10.3.1.4,10.3.3.0; 10.4.1.3,0,0,246,1,17,4,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,2,java/client/org/apache/derby/client/net/NetCursor.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/derbynet/PrepareStatementTest.java;,0,0

See the 'executeConstantAction()' method of CreateIndexConstantAction.java (search for 'duplicate').But there is a bug in Derby where  if one of the constraints is unique and is dropped  the uniqueness 'attribute' of the backing index is not updated accordingly. This means that uniqueness may be incorrectly enforced where it is not required.Take the following example ('Case 2' from DERBY-2204): ALTER TABLE NEWORDERS ADD CONSTRAINT NEWORDERS_PK PRIMARY KEY(NO_W_ID  NO_D_ID  NO_O_ID); ALTER TABLE NEWORDERS ADD CONSTRAINT NO_O_FK FOREIGN KEY (NO_W_ID  NO_D_ID  NO_O_ID) REFERENCES ORDERS;For these statements Derby will use a single backing index for both the primary constraint NEWORDERS_PK and the foreign key constraint NO_O_FK. That backing index will be unique because the primary key must itself be unique.If later we drop the primary key: ALTER TABLE NEWORDERS DROP CONSTRAINT NEWORDERS_PK;then the backing index needs to be converted from a unique index to a non-unique index (because a foreign key is not inherently unique). But in Derby the uniqueness attribute remains unchanged  so attempts to insert a duplicate (NO_W_ID  NO_D_ID  NO_O_ID) row into NEWORDERS will fail with error 23505  when it should really succeed.I tried this out on 10.1.3.1 and the same behavior occurs there  so marking 'Affects' versions for everything back to that...,10.1.3.1; 10.2.1.6; 10.2.2.0; 10.3.1.4; 10.3.2.1; 10.4.1.3,10.4.1.3,0,0,262,1,14,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,4,14,java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/ConglomerateSharingTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/GrantRevokeDDLTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/_Suite.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/ConglomerateDescriptor.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/ConstraintDescriptor.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/AlterTableConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/DropConstraintConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/DropIndexConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/DropTableConstantAction.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/RowLockIso.out;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/ConglomerateDescriptor.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/ConstraintDescriptor.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/DDLSingleTableConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/CreateIndexConstantAction.java;,0,0

From the jdk1.6 javadoc of Collator.getAvailableLocales() I see that only Locale.US is strictly required:public static Locale[] getAvailableLocales() Returns an array of all locales for which the getInstance methods of this class can return localized instances. The returned array represents the union of locales supported by the Java runtime and by installed CollatorProvider implementations. It must contain at least a Locale instance equal to Locale.US. Returns: An array of locales for which localized Collator instances are available.This led me to thinking about how Derby should behave if created/booted with collation=TERRITORY_BASED and territory=&lt;some unsupported locale&gt;. I'm not sure what the consequences could be if the database is first created on a platform that supports whatever locale is set and later booted with one that doesn't  or created on a platform missing support and later booted with one that has. In any case I think it may confuse a user needlessly to see the database boot successfully with his collation setting and later behave in a way he does not expect.Opinions voiced on the derby-dev list are that both database creation and boot should fail if collation=TERRITORY_BASED and the selected locale is not supported.If a change like this is implemented  the collationtests should be changed to verify correct behavior also if they are executed in an environment were some of the tested locales are not supported.,10.4.1.3,10.3.3.0; 10.4.1.3; 10.5.1.1,0,0,268,1,44,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,8,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/DataValueFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/DataValueFactoryImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/db/BasicDatabase.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/DataDictionaryImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages.xml;java/shared/org/apache/derby/shared/common/reference/SQLState.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/CollationTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/ErrorCodeTest.java;,0,0

Also there is no change to existing or newly created constraints on keys with no nullable columns.,10.4.1.3,10.4.1.3,1,2,97,1,71,9,0,0,0,0,0,0,6,44,java/engine/org/apache/derby/catalog/types/IndexDescriptorImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/CreateIndexConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeController.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/catalog/IndexDescriptor.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/catalog/types/IndexDescriptorImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/io/RegisteredFormatIds.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/io/StoredFormatIds.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/ConglomerateDescriptor.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/IndexRowGenerator.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/access/AccessFactoryGlobals.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/store/raw/RawStoreFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/DataDictionaryImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/CreateIndexNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/TableElementList.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/CreateIndexConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/GenericConstantActionFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/IndexChanger.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/UniqueWithDuplicateNullsIndexSortObserver.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTree.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeController.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/index/B2I.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/index/B2IFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/index/B2I_10_3.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/sort/ExternalSortFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/sort/MergeSort.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/sort/UniqueWithDuplicateNullsExternalSortFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/sort/UniqueWithDuplicateNullsMergeSort.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/modules.properties;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/altertable.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/db2Compatibility.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/subqueryFlattening.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/NullableUniqueConstraintTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/PrimaryKeyTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/_Suite.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/db2Compatibility.sql;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/subqueryFlattening.sql;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/Changes10_4.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/IndexRowGenerator.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/CreateIndexConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/UniqueWithDuplicateNullsIndexSortObserver.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/sort/ExternalSortFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/sort/UniqueWithDuplicateNullsExternalSortFactory.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/Changes10_4.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/sort/UniqueWithDuplicateNullsMergeSort.java;,0,0

When derbyStress ran in derbyall it ran with 64MB heap so that it could test fixes for various memory leaks. When moved to JDBCHarnessJavaTest it started running with the full 512MB heap used for suites.All so no longer tests for those leaks. There are two options presented so far1) Move it back to derbyall 2) add it to the junit-all target For the adding it to the junit-all target option I think a few things have to happen for it to be run as part of the nightlies. 1) Convert derbyStress.java to junit. 2) create a junit-lomem target and make it part of junit-all. 3) Fix junit-all so that it can run with the nightlies. DERBY-2045 + distribute ant to the testing machines make nightly script changes etc.Myrna expressed some misgivings to relying on junit-all because ant is not available on all the platforms where she tests. I think the best course of action is to at least temporarily move the test back to derbyall and then open separate task(s) for the junit conversion effort.,10.3.2.1; 10.4.1.3,10.3.3.0; 10.4.1.3,0,0,224,1,2,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,2,java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/suites/jdbcapi.runall;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/JDBCHarnessJavaTest.java;,1,1

A good O-O implementation would havethe logic to create a NormalizeResultSetNode self-contained in NormalizeResultSetNode.Since the ResultColumnList of the original ResultSetNode correctly describes the desired outcome  it's not clear tome why NormalizeResultSetNode can't just refer to the same list and use it for its processing. They may be some chancethat this would cause recursion at some point  where a NormalizeResultSetNode would think it needed to be wrappedin a NormalizeResultSetNode since the types of its columns and expression don't match (i.e. when it is handled as a regular ResultSetNode).I think moving the setup of a NormalizeResultSetNode into the class itself  so that its inputs are just the ResultSetNode to wrapwould help clear up the code  especially if comments were added indicating why certain actions were being taken.I am separating this task out into a separate issue  so that it can be worked on independently of DERBY-3310.,10.4.1.3,10.5.1.1,0,0,194,1,10,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,10,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/InsertNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/NormalizeResultSetNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ResultColumnList.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/UnionNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/UpdateNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/InsertNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/NormalizeResultSetNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ResultSetNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/UnionNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/UpdateNode.java;,0,0

This is partly dependent on DERBY-2892. b) Invoke Connection.commit (or rollback) periodically  which causes all locators on the connection to be released.,10.3.2.1; 10.4.1.3; 10.5.1.1,10.3.3.0; 10.4.1.3; 10.5.1.1,0,0,108,1,25,4,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,9,java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/Connection.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/Cursor.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/LOBStateTracker.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/ResultSet.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/Statement.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/net/NetConnection.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/net/NetCursor.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/derbynet/LOBLocatorReleaseTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/derbynet/_Suite.java;,1,1

There is mention of dynamic versus static sections in the comments (this one from am.Statement): // If a dataSource is passed into resetClientConnection()  then we will assume // properties on the dataSource may have changed  and we will need to go through // the open-statement list on the connection and do a full reset on all statements  // including preparedStatement's and callableStatement's. This is because property // change may influence the section we allocate for the preparedStatement  and // also the cursor attributes  i.e. setCursorSensitivity(). // If no dataSource is passed into resetClientConnection()  then we will do the // minimum reset required for preparedStatement's and callableStatement's.Note that the reset code for statements is also invoked when ClientPooledConnection.getConnection() is invoked. I do not understand why we should reset statements when we get a new logical connection.Further  I also suspect the concept of a deferred reset has been introduced because of the feature/bug described by this Jira issue. A deferred reset seems to be a mechanism to avoid a round-trip to validate the newly changed DataSource properties (typically user  password and security mechanism).I will look into removing code related to deferred resets as well. If you have historic information about these parts of the driver  I would appreciate if you share it with the community if possible.Just to be clear  it is my opinion that changed DataSource properties should take effect when one of the following methods is invoked: DataSource.getConnection() ConnectionPoolDataSource.getPooledConnection() XADataSource.getXAConnection()All of the methods above returns a physical connection. Properties like user name and password are associated with the physical connection  and thus requests to obtain a logical connection should not cause any of these properties to change.,10.3.2.1; 10.4.1.3; 10.5.1.1,10.4.2.0; 10.5.1.1,0,0,371,1,13,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,9,java/client/org/apache/derby/client/ClientPooledConnection.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/Connection.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/net/NetConnection.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/ClientPooledConnection.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/Connection.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/net/NetConnection.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/ClientPooledConnection.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/Connection.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/net/NetConnection.java;,1,1

That includes OLAP expressions. I believe this is so because  according to part 2  section 10.10 (&lt;sort specification&gt;)  a &lt;sort key&gt; can be any &lt;value expression&gt; and if you follow the grammar for &lt;value expression&gt;  it can resolve to be a &lt;value expression primary&gt; (see section 6.3)  which can in turn resolve to be a &lt;window function&gt;. This reasoning is supported by tracing the hotlinks on the following page which lays out the SQL 2003 BNF: http://savage.net.au/SQL/sql-2003-2.bnf.html This interpretation is further supported by the example of an ORDER BY clause referencing an OLAP expression which is provided on page 23 of the introduction to OLAP written by Fred Zemke  Krishna Kulkarni  Andy Witkowski  and Bob Lyle: www.cse.iitb.ac.in/dbms/Data/Papers-Other/SQL1999/OLAP-99-154r2.pdf,10.4.1.3,10.6.1.0,1,1,221,1,44,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,63,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/compile/C_NodeTypes.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/execute/ResultSetFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/C_NodeNames.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ColumnReference.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/NodeFactoryImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/OrderByList.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ProjectRestrictNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ResultColumn.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ResultColumnList.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/RowNumberColumnNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/SelectNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/SubqueryNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/WindowFunctionColumnNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/WindowNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/sqlgrammar.jj;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/GenericResultSetFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/RealResultSetStatisticsFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/WindowResultSet.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/rts/RealWindowResultSetStatistics.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/_Suite.java;tools/jar/DBMSnodes.properties;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/compile/C_NodeTypes.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/execute/ResultSetFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/AggregateNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/AggregateWindowFunctionNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/C_NodeNames.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ColumnReference.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/DeleteNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/FromList.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/GroupByColumn.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/GroupByNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/JoinNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/NodeFactoryImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/OrderByColumn.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ProjectRestrictNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ReplaceWindowFuncCallsWithCRVisitor.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/RowNumberFunctionNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/RowResultSetNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/SelectNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/SetOperatorNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/SubqueryNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/WindowDefinitionNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/WindowFunctionNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/WindowList.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/WindowNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/WindowReferenceNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/WindowResultSetNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/sqlgrammar.jj;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/GenericResultSetFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/RealResultSetStatisticsFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/WindowResultSet.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/rts/RealWindowResultSetStatistics.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages.xml;java/shared/org/apache/derby/shared/common/reference/SQLState.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/OLAPTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/_Suite.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/util/SQLStateConstants.java;tools/jar/DBMSnodes.properties;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/RowNumberColumnNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/WindowFunctionColumnNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/WindowNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/WindowResultSet.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/rts/RealWindowResultSetStatistics.java;,0,0

However  I suspect that this affects all previous releases of Derby as well.In resolving method signatures for function/procedure invocations  the SQL standard makes the following definitions in part 13  section 4.5 (parameter mapping). These definitions  in turn  refer to tables B-1 and B-3 in JDBC 3.0 Specification  Final Release  October 2001 (&#91;JDBC&#93;). Simply mappable - This refers to the correspondence of SQL and Java types described in &#91;JDBC&#93; table B-1. This is the table which defines the mapping of SQL types to Java primitives. Object mappable - This refers to the correspondence of SQL and Java types described in &#91;JDBC&#93; table B-3. This is the table which defines the mapping of SQL types to Java wrapper objects. Output mappable - For OUT and INOUT parameters  this refers to a single element array whose cell is simply mappable or object mappable. E.g. Integer[] or float[]. Mappable - This means simply  object  or output mappable. Result set mappable - This means a single element array whose cell is a type which implements either java.sql.ResultSet or sqlj.runtime.ResultSetIterator.Putting all of this together  section 4.5 continues: 'A Java method with M parameters is mappable (to SQL) if and only if  for some N  0 (zero) &lt;= N &lt;= M  the data types of the first N parameters are mappable  the last M - N parameters are result set mappable  and the result type is either simply mappable  object mappable  or void.'Section 8.6 gives more detailed rules  but they are hard to follow. According to section 8.6  when resolving a routine invocation  Derby should expect to find one and only one static mappable method with the expected external name (Java class + method name).I believe that this is a fair description of the rules. This  at least  is what some other databases appear to do. See  for instance  http://infocenter.sybase.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.sybase.help.ase_15.0.java/html/java/java126.htm and http://www.service-architecture.com/database/articles/mapping_sql_and_java_data_types.htmlWe do not have a regression test which verifies that Derby applies the SQL standard resolution rules. There may be several divergences from the standard. This JIRA is a place to track those discrepancies. Here is one that I have noticed:The following SQL signature( a int ) returns intshould be mappable to any of the following Java signaturespublic static int f( int a )public static int f( Integer a )public static Integer f( int a )public static Integer f( Integer a )However  I observe that Derby is only able to resolve the first and third signatures (the ones with primitive arguments). I will attach a test case showing this problem.I will also attach an html table summarizing the simply and object mappable rules.,10.5.1.1,10.5.1.1,0,0,445,1,43,4,1,0,0,0,0,0,14,44,java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignatures.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignaturesTest.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/catalog/IndexDescriptor.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/catalog/types/IndexDescriptorImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/loader/ClassInspector.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/IndexRowGenerator.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/UnaryComparisonOperatorNode.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignatures.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignaturesTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/_Suite.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/loader/ClassInspector.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignatures.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignaturesTest.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/loader/ClassInspector.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignaturesTest.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/loader/ClassInspector.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/lockTableVti.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/onlineBackupTest2.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignaturesTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/closed.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/lockTableVti.sql;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/onlineBackupTest2.sql;java/engine/org/apache/derby/catalog/SystemProcedures.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/loader/ClassInspector.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignaturesTest.java;java/tools/org/apache/derby/iapi/tools/run.java;java/tools/org/apache/derby/loc/toolsmessages.properties;java/tools/org/apache/derby/tools/SignatureChecker.java;tools/jar/tools.properties;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/loader/ClassInspector.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignatures.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignaturesTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignatures.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignaturesTest.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/services/loader/ClassInspector.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignatures.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignatures.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignaturesTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignatures.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignaturesTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignatures.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignaturesTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignatures.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AnsiSignaturesTest.java;,0,0

It also require a slight rewrite of 'PositionedStoreStream.skipFully' and 'PositionedStoreStream.reposition' to be able to determine the position of the stream (the length in this case).Option a) will cause the first page of the stream to be read into the cache (if not already there)  but taken the reason for doing this is an error condition it seems acceptable.A correct value of the position variable is required for correct/valid operation of PositionedStoreStream.,10.3.3.0; 10.4.1.3; 10.5.1.1,10.4.2.0; 10.5.1.1,0,0,182,1,12,2,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,3,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/PositionedStoreStream.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/PositionedStoreStreamTest.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/PositionedStoreStream.java;,0,0

This leads to the session variablesCURRENT_ROLE/CURRENT_SCHEMA not being set correctly in these contexts(they should inherited from the parent context  cf DERBY-3327).For method calls  this is being handled by generating a call tolcc.setupNestedSessionContext (seeStaticMethodCallNode#generateSetupNestedSessionContext)In some of these nested contexts  one or both of the session variablesCURRENT_ROLE/CURRENT_SCHEMA can be referenced  in othersnot. Obviously  if they can  this will lead to errors. The followingcontexts will have this problem: ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN &lt;colname&gt; &lt;coltype&gt; DEFAULT CURRENT_ROLE In the AlterTableConstantAction  a nested UPDATE statement is used to give existing rows the new column its default value. This execution context is nested  cf. AlterTableConstantAction#executeUpdate TRIGGER body execution may reference CURRENT_ROLE/CURRENT_SCHEMA. The body executes in a nested context  cf.

Satoor,2009/08/12 17:23:08 +0100,287.3098495,110.9834375,Incorrect ORDER BY caused by index,I think I found a bug in Derby that is triggered by an index on a large column: VARCHAR(1024). I know it is generally not a good idea to have an index on such a large column.I have a table (table2) with a column 'value'  my query orders on this column but the result is not sorted. It is sorted if I remove the index on that column.The output of the attached script is as follows (results should be ordered on the middle column):ID |VALUE |VALUE----------------------------------------------2147483653 |000002 |218572147483654 |000003 |218574294967297 |000001 |21857While I would expect:ID |VALUE |VALUE----------------------------------------------4294967297 |000001 |218572147483653 |000002 |218572147483654 |000003 |21857This is the definition:CREATE TABLE table1 (id BIGINT NOT NULL  PRIMARY KEY(id));CREATE INDEX key1 ON table1(id);CREATE TABLE table2 (id BIGINT NOT NULL  name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL  value VARCHAR(1024)  PRIMARY KEY(id  name));CREATE UNIQUE INDEX key2 ON table2(id  name);CREATE INDEX key3 ON table2(value);This is the query:SELECT table1.id  m0.value  m1.valueFROM table1  table2 m0  table2 m1WHERE table1.id=m0.idAND m0.name='PageSequenceId'AND table1.id=m1.idAND m1.name='PostComponentId'AND m1.value='21857'ORDER BY m0.value;The bug can be reproduced by just executing the attached script with the ij-tool.Note that the result of the query becomes correct when enough data is changed. This prevented me from creating a smaller example.See the attached file 'derby-reproduce.zip' for sysinfo  derby.log and script.sql.Michael Segel pointed out:'It looks like its hitting the index ordering on id name from table 2 and is ignoring the order by clause.',10.1.3.3; 10.2.2.1; 10.3.3.1; 10.4.2.0,10.1.3.3; 10.2.2.1; 10.3.3.1; 10.4.2.1; 10.5.2.0; 10.6.1.0,0,0,226,1,88,11,0,1,0,0,0,0,4,16,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/compile/OptimizablePredicateList.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/compile/RequiredRowOrdering.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/compile/RowOrdering.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/FromBaseTable.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/OptimizerImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/OrderByList.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/PredicateList.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/RowOrderingImpl.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/wisconsin.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/OrderByAndSortAvoidance.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/_Suite.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/wisc_setup.sql;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/OrderByAndSortAvoidance.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/RuntimeStatisticsParser.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/compile/OptimizablePredicateList.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/OrderByAndSortAvoidance.java;,0,0

The program pounds on Derby by running jobs on a pool of 10 threads. Each job creates a new Derby database  a schema  a table  and an index. Then it shuts down the database and finishes. The program runs until an error occurs or until 1000 jobs have finished.The problem is very intermittent  and related I think to multithreaded access of a vector 'moduleInstances' in TopService.java. I am seeing the error on my machine about half the time I run the test program. Sometimes it happens after 100 or 200 jobs...but sometimes not until 500 or more  or not at all.I am using the 10.4.2 derby.jar downloaded from http://db.apache.org/derby/releases/release-10.4.2.0.cgi  without any modifications on my part.I will attach the test program plus output from a run that failed with the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. (The actual exception thrown to the application from Derby is SQLException  but the underlying cause is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.)

According to the test coverage reports  this code is not exercised by any of the existing tests. if (latch_released) { // lost latch on page in order to wait for row lock. // Because we have scan lock on page  we need only // call reposition() which will use the saved record // handle to reposition to the same spot on the page. // We don't have to search the // tree again  as we have the a scan lock on the page // which means the current_rh is valid to reposition on. if (reposition(scan_position  false)) { throw StandardException.newException( SQLState.AM_RECORD_NOT_FOUND  new Long(err_containerid)  new Long(scan_position.current_rh.getId())); } } },10.4.2.0,10.7.1.1,0,0,176,1,4,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,2,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/access/btree/BTreeScan.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/unitTests/store/T_b2i.java;,0,0

There should be an ant target which sets the correct classpath to run all tests after an initial checkout and 'ant all'.The current situation is very confusing to beginners and people who try to build Derby for the first time. For example  when running the tests  I got this exception:java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.apache.derbyTesting.junit.EnvTestbut that class was there  the file was there  everything was correct. Googling for the error didn't turn anything up  either. It took me a while to believe that build.xml just wouldn't try to setup a classpath for the tests.,10.4.2.0,10.9.1.0,0,1,99,1,11,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,build.xml;,0,0

We should probably hold off on these improvements however until the root cause of DERBY-4152 is established  however  so we don't muddy the waters with that issue by changing the test.1) DbTasks.moveToFolders may throw an IllegalArgumentException. There is a line: message_id = Rn.nextInt(count - 1); if count is 1 the argument to nextInt() might be 0 which is not allowed. I hit this once but lost the stack trace  but it is apparent that when there is only one row in the table this can occur.2) Allow/implement multiple attachments per message and cleanup DbTasks.insertMail() logic. Remove the attach_id column from INBOX to allow multiple attachments. -Make the attachment insert part of the message for loop in insertMail. Use getGeneratedKeys() to get the id of the inserted message. When attachments are inserted  insert (1-4) attachments and give them a corresponding attach_id from 1-4.This will allow for removal of the select statements used to determine id and attach_id. I'll file another issue for these improvements if folks agree that they are sensible.A detailed description of the current implementation of insertMail is described at https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12405685/insertMailSummary.txt3) DbTasks.databaseSize calculation is wrong. It doesn't match du -sk.

The values of the last table column were filled with values from other rows!After performing a few tests I could break down the problem to the SQL statement 'INSERT INTO table SELECT FROM (...)'To reprocude the effect do the following:1. unpack attached database 'rmdb.zip'2. connect to the database with embedded driver  User: IGEL Password: test 3. read data of an example row from database select * from stringrangenew where classname = 'x.xserver%.colordepth';result is  x.xserver%.colordepth 2 &#91;16&#93; &#91;24&#93; &#91;32&#93;4. now copy the data to the second table (column INSTANCENR has been added to this table) INSERT INTO STRINGRANGENEW_ (CLASSNAME FIRMWAREID RVALUE) SELECT CLASSNAME FIRMWAREID RVALUE FROM STRINGRANGENEW;5. select data of example row from second table select * from stringrangenew_ where classname = 'x.xserver%.colordepth';result is  x.xserver%.colordepth 2 -1 &#91;CCW&#93;&#91;CW&#93;&#91;XX&#93;-&gt; value of last column is not the same as in orignal table!Here some additional information i worked out during my tests: if you change the copy statement to include the additional column INSTANCENR  the copied data are correct. delete from STRINGRANGENEW_; INSERT INTO STRINGRANGENEW_ (CLASSNAME FIRMWAREID  INSTANCENR  RVALUE) SELECT CLASSNAME FIRMWAREID  -1  RVALUE FROM STRINGRANGENEW; if you select the rows only 'SELECT CLASSNAME FIRMWAREID RVALUE FROM STRINGRANGENEW'  the result shows correct dataNote: The effect is not restricted to this row but also applies to other rows.

However  the performance differs significantly between the different queries.The queries use the tours db and look like this:(1)SELECT * FROM CITIES LEFT OUTER JOIN (FLIGHTS CROSS JOIN COUNTRIES) ON CITIES.AIRPORT = FLIGHTS.ORIG_AIRPORT WHERE COUNTRIES.COUNTRY_ISO_CODE = 'US'(2)SELECT * FROM CITIES LEFT OUTER JOIN FLIGHTS INNER JOIN COUNTRIES ON 1=1 ON CITIES.AIRPORT = FLIGHTS.ORIG_AIRPORT WHERE COUNTRIES.COUNTRY_ISO_CODE = 'US'(3)SELECT * FROM CITIES LEFT OUTER JOIN (SELECT * FROM FLIGHTS  COUNTRIES) S ON CITIES.AIRPORT = S.ORIG_AIRPORT WHERE S.COUNTRY_ISO_CODE = 'US'When executed in ij  (1) and (2) need 6 seconds to complete  whereas (3) completes in 50 ms.The query plans for (1) and (2) use nested loop joins and table scans. (3) uses a combination of hash join and nested loop join  and index scans as well as table scans.It looks like (3) has been rewritten from a left outer join to an inner join internally. This is fine because all rows that have the right-side columns filled with NULLs will be filtered out by the predicate S.COUNTRY_ISO_CODE='US'  so the extra rows generated by the outer join will not be returned.This optimization should also be possible for (1) and (2).

It fixes DERBY-3645  DERBY-3646 and DERBY-2349 (there may be more Jiras).The core of the fix is cloning certain DVDs being selected/projected in multiple columns. There are two types of cloning: A) materializing clone B) stream clone(A) can be implemented already  (B) requires code to clone a stream without materializing it. Note that the streams I'm talking about are streams originating from the store.Testing revealed the following: the cost of the checks performed to figure out if cloning is required seems acceptable (negligible?) in some cases (A) has better performance than (B) because the raw data only has to be decoded once stream clones are preferred when the data value is above a certain size for several reasons: avoids potential out-of-memory errors (and in case of a server environment  it lowers the memory pressure) avoids decoding the whole value if the JDBC streaming APIs are used to access only parts of the value avoids decoding overall in cases where the value isn't accessed by the client / user (this statement conflicts with the performance observation above)We don't always know the size of a value  and since the fix code deals with all kinds of data types  it is slightly more costly to try to obtain the size.What do people think about the following goal statement?Goals:----- Phase 1 1) No crashes or wrong results due to stream reuse when executing duplicate column selections (minus goal 4) 2) Minimal performance degradation for non-duplicate column selections 3) Only a minor performance degradation for duplicate [&#91;LONG&#93; VAR]CHAR &#91;FOR BIT DATA&#93; column selections----- Phase 2 4) No out-of-memory exceptions during execution of duplicate column selections of BLOB/CLOB 5) Optimize BLOB/CLOB cloningI think phase 1 can proceed by reviewing and discussing the prototype patch. Phase 2 requires more discussion and work (see DERBY-3650).A note about the bug behavior facts:Since this issue is the underlying cause for several other reported issues  I have decided to be liberal when setting the bug behavior facts.

I'm all ears for better names for the clone methods (another suggestion mentioned is cloneDeep  cloneHalfDeep  and cloneShallow).NOTE: See comment below  the method names changed during the course of development.cloneValue &lt;deep&gt; (new method  functionality was present through combined calls to the DVD public interface)  a DVD obtained through cloneValue is independent of other DVDs and the state of the Derby store the data value will be materializedcloneState &lt;halfDeep&gt; (~= DataValueDescriptor.getClone) a DVD obtained through cloneState is independent of other DVDs  but may depend on the state of the Derby store (due to references to store streams) the data value will be materialized if the value is represented by a non-cloneable stream or if Derby believes materializing the value is more appropriate than keeping the stream representationcloneHolder &lt;shallow&gt; (~= CloneableObject.cloneObject) a DVD obtained through cloneHolder is dependent on the original DVD and its clones made through cloneHolder. If one of the DVDs changes its state  all of them will be affected. Will also be dependent on the state of the Derby store if there are references to store streams. the data value will never be materialized due to cloneHolder being invokedFor many of the data types  cloneState and cloneHolder will forward to cloneValue.cloneState will be used the most. cloneValue is currently only required in the sorter. cloneHolder is required (for performance reasons and maybe to avoid OOME) when DVDs pass through temporary holders (BackingStoreHashtable  TemporaryRowHolderImpl). I have not gone through all the usages of cloneState to see if any of them can be  or has to be  replaced with another clone-call.The ability to clone store streams will be added by Mike's patch attached to DERBY-3650. New method names:It turned out that using only two methods was sufficient:cloneHolder &lt;shallow&gt; (as above)cloneValue(boolean forceMaterialization) &lt;halfDeep or deep&gt;Basically

This can get confusing when you have multiple versions on the same machine.I've worked around this in the past by pointing ant at other directories with -Duser.home=...  but it would be easier to have another place set up - I don't really like changing user.home.We could add another line to build.xml  e.g.  for trunk's current build.xml:@@ -20 6 +20 7 @@ &lt;!-- Set Properties --&gt; &lt;!-- User settings --&gt;+ &lt;property file='ant.properties'/&gt; &lt;property file='${user.home}/ant.properties'/&gt; &lt;!-- Set property lib dir --&gt; &lt;property name='properties.dir' value='tools/ant/properties'/&gt;This would make ant look first for ant.properties in the same directory as the top level build.xml  and secondly for the one in user.home.If the community agrees this would be ok  I'd like to make this change and backport it all the way to 10.0.By having an additional place we'd not cause incompatibilities to other build processes (except if someone has put an ant.properties file in the top of the checked out tree).If we do this  I think it's up to the developers to ensure that there's not 2 ant.properties files that are conflicting.,10.0.2.2; 10.1.3.3; 10.2.2.1; 10.3.3.1; 10.4.2.1; 10.5.3.1; 10.6.1.0,10.1.3.3; 10.2.2.1; 10.3.3.1; 10.4.2.1; 10.5.3.1; 10.6.2.1; 10.7.1.1,0,0,187,1,14,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,4,BUILDING.html;build.xml;build.xml;BUILDING.html;,0,0

Wanvik,2010/09/24 20:36:39 +0100,219.6828588,124.822662,Allow database user to execute stored procedures with same permissions as database owner and/or routine definer,Curretnly there is no way to hide data and database structure in embedded derby from the end user. One way to accomplish the above requirement is as follows:1. Create encrypted database so data is protected2. Enable authentication and sql authorization in database3. Create two users  dbUser and dbOwner4. Store application logic as stored procedure in the databse so dbUser does not know what tables are accecced by the application logic  thus hiding table structure5. Revoke select permission from dbUser so he cannot describe tables thus protecting table structures6. Give only Execute permissions on stored procedures to dbUserThe above steps will ensure that data and data structure is hidden when application is delivered to end user.The problem is  if user does not have select permission  the stored procedures will not execute. So I am requesting the following enhancement to Derby:If dbOwner has given Execure permission to stored procecure to a dbUser  then allow stored procedure to execute even if the dbUser has no select permission. In otherwords  When dbUser calls stored procedure  database will use dbOwners authorization to execute stored procedure rather than dbUsers. This may be implemented by creating new permission called RunAsDbOwner.DbOwner can then grant permission to dbUser to execute a stored procedure with RunAsDbOwner.If this is implemented  applications can be created which will truely hide the database structure and data from end users. Database will behave as a blackbox with only in/out data exposed in stored procedures.,10.0.2.0; 10.0.2.1; 10.1.1.0; 10.1.2.1; 10.1.3.1; 10.2.1.6; 10.2.2.0; 10.3.1.4; 10.3.2.1; 10.3.3.0; 10.4.1.3; 10.4.2.0; 10.5.1.1; 10.5.2.0; 10.5.3.0; 10.6.1.0,10.7.1.1,1,2,239,1,59,5,0,1,0,1,0,0,3,52,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/EmbedResultSet.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/BaseActivation.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/RoutinesDefinersRightsTest.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/catalog/types/RoutineAliasInfo.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/conn/Authorizer.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/conn/LanguageConnectionContext.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/conn/SQLSessionContext.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/SchemaDescriptor.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/StatementColumnPermission.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/StatementGenericPermission.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/StatementPermission.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/StatementRolePermission.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/StatementRoutinePermission.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/StatementSchemaPermission.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/StatementTablePermission.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/EmbedConnection.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/DataDictionaryImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/CreateAliasNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/DropSchemaNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/SpecialFunctionNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/StaticMethodCallNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/sqlgrammar.jj;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/conn/GenericAuthorizer.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/conn/GenericLanguageConnectionContext.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/conn/SQLSessionContextImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/CreateRoleConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/CreateSchemaConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/DDLConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/GenericPrivilegeInfo.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/GrantRoleConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/RevokeRoleConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/RoutinePrivilegeInfo.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/SetRoleConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/SetSchemaConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/TablePrivilegeInfo.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/xact/TransactionTableEntry.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNet/dblook_test_net.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNet/dblook_test_net_territory.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNetClient/dblook_test_net.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/DerbyNetClient/dblook_test_net_territory.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/dblook_test.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/dblook_test_territory.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/J2EEDataSourceTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/RoutinesDefinersRightsTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/SQLSessionContextTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/_Suite.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/tools/dblook_makeDB.sql;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/Changes10_7.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/JDBC.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/conn/LanguageConnectionContext.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/conn/GenericLanguageConnectionContext.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/JDBC.java;,0,0

When inserting a lot of short values  the pressure on the Java garbage collector is unnecessary high and the allocation/GC also causes a somewhat higher CPU usage.This effect of this issue can easily be reduced by sizing the buffer in the appropriate cases.,10.7.1.1,10.5.3.1; 10.6.2.1; 10.7.1.1,0,0,87,1,7,2,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,5,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/CharStreamHeaderGenerator.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/ClobStreamHeaderGenerator.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/ReaderToUTF8Stream.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/SQLClob.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/StreamHeaderGenerator.java;,0,0

It would be good to have a regression test which tracks Derby's actual implementation. For the moment  it appears that Derby conforms to the defined behavior  does something reasonable in the undefined cases  and behaves the same way in the embedded and client drivers.The behavior of ResultSet.getBoolean() does not appear to have been defined until JDBC 4. Here is the JDBC 4 javadoc:'If the designated column has a datatype of CHAR or VARCHAR and contains a '0' or has a datatype of BIT  TINYINT  SMALLINT  INTEGER or BIGINT and contains a 0  a value of false is returned. If the designated column has a datatype of CHAR or VARCHAR and contains a '1' or has a datatype of BIT  TINYINT  SMALLINT  INTEGER or BIGINT and contains a 1  a value of true is returned.' The behavior for those datatypes is not specified if the actual value is not 0 or 1. However  in a private communication I have the following statement of intent from Lance Andersen  the JDBC spec lead:'Note: Please refer to your driver documentation for the return value when the designated column contains a values other than '0'  0  '1' or 1.'In addition  the behavior for other datatypes is not specified. Some day it might be good if Derby's documentation described our behavior in the unspecified cases.

Although it did not seem to impact the queryresult  I note it here as as something we should probably investiateas it may be a symptom an underlying problem  or a potential forfuture problems.The query looks like this:select b3.* from b3 join bvw on (b3.c8 = bvw.c5) join b4 on (bvw.c1 = b4.c7) where b4.c4 = 42'and the underlying DDL is this:create table b2 (c1 int  c2 int  c3 char(1)  c4 int  c5 int  c6 int);create table b4 (c7 int  c4 int  c6 int);create table b3 (c8 int  c9 int  c5 int  c6 int);create table b (c1 int  c2 int  c3 char(1)  c4 int  c5 int  c6 int);create view bvw (c5  c1  c2  c3  c4) asselect c5  c1  c2  c3  c4 from b2 unionselect c5  c1  c2  c3  c4 from b;create view bvw2 (c1  c2  c3  c4  c5) asAfter the bind phase  the join clause 'bvw.c1 = b4.c7' has thefollowing entry for the column reference bvw.C1: tableNumber: 1 columnNumber: 6The problem is that the node with tablenumber 1 is bvw  which is theview with the subquery for the union  which has only 5 resultingcolumns  so 6 must be wrong. Although both the view participant tables(b  b2) both have six column  the view does not. In any case  C1 iscolumn 2 in the view and column 2 in the two union selects from both band b2.C1 is however  column 6 of the join node resulting from 'select b3.*from b3 join bvw on (b3.c8 = bvw.c5)'  but the correct table number forthat would be 5  not 1.So  it would seem the table number has been bound to the bvw view'sresult set  but the column number has been bound to the innermost joinnode's result set.

These are the ones I'm aware of:1) On the boundary between non-leap years and leap years it will return first day of thirteenth month in previous year (for instance  2011-13-01 instead of 2012-01-01)2) It treats all years divisible by four as leap years. Those divisible by 100 and not by 400 are not leap years. It attempts to adjust for that (see the snippet below) but it always ends up setting leapYear=true if (year%4)==0. // It's a leap year if divisible by 4  unless divisible by 100  // unless divisible by 400. if ((year % 4L) == 0) { if ((year % 100L) == 0) { if ((year % 400L) == 0) { leapYear = true; } } leapYear = true; }3) More leap year trouble. To find out which year it is  it calculates the number of four year periods that have elapsed since 1970-01-01. A four year period is considered 365*3+366 days. Although most four year periods are of that length  some are shorter  so we'll get one day off starting from year 2100  two days off from year 2200  and so on.,10.7.1.1,10.7.1.1,0,0,189,1,15,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,13,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/util/CheapDateFormatter.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/unitTests/junit/CheapDateFormatterTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/unitTests/junit/_Suite.java;java/drda/org/apache/derby/impl/drda/NetworkServerControlImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/util/CheapDateFormatter.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/locks/Timeout.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/monitor/BaseMonitor.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/stream/BasicGetLogHeader.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/BaseDataFileFactory.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/derbyrunjartest.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/tools/derbyrunjartest_sed.properties;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/unitTests/junit/CheapDateFormatterTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/unitTests/junit/_Suite.java;,0,0

BaseMonitor.getDefaultModuleProperties() apparently intends to use values from the first modules.properties file that mentions a property: String key = (String) newKeys.nextElement(); if( moduleList.contains( key)) // RESOLVE how do we localize messages before we have finished initialization? report( 'Ignored duplicate property ' + key + ' in ' + modulesPropertiesURL.toString()); else moduleList.setProperty( key  otherList.getProperty( key));However  moduleList.contains(key) doesn't look for a key in moduleList  it looks for a property value. This code should have used containsKey() instead.Beacuse of this  the last modules.properties on the classpath will take precedence over the ones earlier on the classpath. So if you for example have two different versions of derby.jar in the classpath  the engine will use the classes from the first jar and modules.properties from the last jar.,10.6.1.0,10.7.1.1,0,0,142,1,3,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/monitor/BaseMonitor.java;,0,0

After that we add the jar to the repositories of our class loaderand call Class drc = Class.forName('org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver'  true  ourclassloader);Driver drv = (Driver)drc.newInstance();this worked perfectly for many years up to version 10.6.1.0  but ceased to work in 10.6.2.1; i assume the unreleased future versions are affected  toowhen derby.jar is placed in the classpath manually before starting our setup  everything works fine regardless of the derby version.investigations lead to the following conclusion: since rev. 982370 this is broken  in the immediate predecessor rev. 980035 it worked. rev. 982370 in the org.apache.derby.impl.store.raw.data.BaseDataFileFactory class introduced a new method private static String jarClassPath(final Class cls) which tries to find the jarfile from which derby was loaded. it contains the following lines: if ( cs == null ) return null;URL result = cs.getLocation();return result.toString();  but in the case  when we dynamically load derby   cs is not null but cs.getLocation() is null. so i propose to change the line with the if to:...if ( cs == null || cs.getLocation()==null) return null;...or maybe it would be better to surround the whole body of the method with a try catch  since it is not essential  and a null return value is also ok?thank you for your efforts concerning derby at large  Michael,10.6.2.1,10.8.1.2,0,2,263,1,11,4,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/store/raw/data/BaseDataFileFactory.java;,0,0

I believe that similar nonsense comes back when you try other mismatched getters on other datatypes: 'An attempt was made to get a data value of type 'java.sql.Types 4' from a data value of type 'java.sql.Time'.'The exception is a java.sql.SQLDataException with SQLState 22005. The embedded driver returns a better message: 'An attempt was made to get a data value of type 'java.sql.Time' from a data value of type INTEGER'.'I recommend two improvements to the utility method which generates these exceptions:1) Flip the order of the type names.2) Use the ResultSetMetaData to look up the source data type name.,10.8.1.2,10.8.1.2,0,0,117,1,3,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/Cursor.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/SqlException.java;,0,0

This will cause the column positions to be recalculated within the tablealter table tab drop column element_id; --mytrig is still looking for column altered_id at position 2 but drop column has changed it's position within the table to 1update tab set altered_id='bb';As shown in the example above  table 'TAB' only has 2 columns. The trigger 'MYTRIG' uses the 2nd column in it's trigger action through the REFERENCING clause. During trigger action sql parsing  every column referenced through REFERENCING clause gets transformed into a reference to the column through it's column position in the trigger table(this change to look for columns based on their column positions rather than the name went in as revision 397959 with following commit comments DERBY-1258 Change the generated code for a new/old column in a row trigger to access columns by position and not name to avoid the case-insensitive name lookup specified by JDBC.) When in the script above  we drop the column in position 1  the trigger 'MYTRIG' ends up becoming invalid because column being used in the trigger action is no more in column position 2.One possible solution is to regenerate the SPSDescriptor associated with the trigger action for all the triggers defined on the table whose column is getting dropped. We could be little smarter and only regenerate the SPSDescriptor for the triggers who use the REFERENCING clause. But we need to do more testing to make sure that triggers without REFERENCING clause do not get impacted by a drop of column which is not the last column of the table. This optimization of recognizing the right triggers may not be worth it since performance may not be that big a criteria for an ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN which should be a rare operation in a production system.An interim solution to this problem is obviously to drop and recreate the triggers,10.3.1.4; 10.3.2.1; 10.3.3.0; 10.4.1.3; 10.4.2.0; 10.5.1.1; 10.5.2.0; 10.5.3.0; 10.6.1.0; 10.6.2.1; 10.7.1.1,10.7.1.4; 10.8.2.2,0,1,437,1,6,4,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,7,java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AlterTableTest.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/DataDictionaryImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/AlterTableConstantAction.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AlterTableTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/Changes10_7.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/AlterTableConstantAction.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AlterTableTest.java;,0,0

The wiki page http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/BuildingDerby instructs NetBeans users to specify the ant.library.dir property in order to get the build working.The Ant documentation says the following about the ant.library.dir property: 'The following property is only set if Ant is started via the Launcher class (which means it may not be set inside IDEs either)' - http://ant.apache.org/manual/properties.htmlSince the property is not guaranteed to be set  I suggest that we replace references to '${ant.library.dir}/ant.jar' with references to '${ant.core.lib}' in the build scripts. According to the above mentioned Ant manual page the ant.core.lib property should always be available and point to ant.jar.

This breaks the pattern used by other operators (which ensures that the result object is not null inside the method that implements the operator  not in the generated bytecode)  and it unnecessarily complicates the code in BinaryOperatorNode.The comments indicate that the current approach was chosen to prevent the null check from happening at execution time  but the generated bytecode does perform the null check at execution time  so generating byte code for it shouldn't have any real benefit over writing Java code for it. In general  implementing as much as possible of the execution time code as Java code is preferred to implementing it directly as bytecode because it's easier to read and debug Java code  and because the generated bytecode cannot be shared between execution plans and take more memory.,10.9.1.0,10.9.1.0,0,0,150,1,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/SQLBinary.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/SQLChar.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/types/SQLLongvarchar.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/BinaryOperatorNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ConcatenationOperatorNode.java;,1,1

Since they haven't been updated for newer versions of NetBeans  I suppose it means they aren't used much. Also  since there are two of them  NetBeans gets confused as to which of the projects to use  and I have experienced that it often uses a mix of the 5.5 and 6.0 projects for the open source files  which causes problems for navigation and debugging. The problem with having multiple NetBeans projects pointing to the same source is described here: http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqSourceRootOverlapTo prevent these problems  we should either remove the tools/ide/netbeans directory and let NetBeans users create their own projects (there a pretty good description on the wiki: http://wiki.apache.org/db-derby/BuildingDerby#Using_NetBeans_to_Build_Derby )  or provide an updated project and remove the old ones.(The project files aren't really tied to a particular version of NetBeans and can be opened by newer versions. But the projects still need to be updated to be usable  I think. For example  they should have project-specific formatting settings (added in NB 6.5  I think) which set tab size to 4  since setting tab size globally to 4 as you would have to with the current projects  only works if Derby is the only project you're working on in NetBeans.),10.9.1.0,10.9.1.0,0,0,217,1,6,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,8,tools/ide/netbeans/5.5/nbproject/project.xml;tools/ide/netbeans/6.0/nbproject/project.xml;tools/ide/netbeans/nbproject/project.xml;build.xml;tools/ide/netbeans/nbproject/ide-file-targets.xml;tools/ide/netbeans/nbproject/project.xml;tools/ide/netbeans/nbproject/ide-file-targets.xml;tools/ide/netbeans/nbproject/project.xml;,0,0

I would think identical results should be returned in all cases and independent on how the view has been defined  but this to my surprise not being the case:1) Trying to select from view appl.'VW_MyTasks' - which is a simple view defined on just one table - leads to expected results  i.e. 'my' tasks are being returned.2) Trying to select from view appl.'VW_MyPriorityTasks - which is a view defined on two joined tables without using an inner join clause - leads to expected results  i.e. 'my' priority tasks are being returned.3) Trying to select from view appl.'VW2_MyPriorityTasks - which is the same view but now the two tables joined using an inner join clause - leads to an error and no tasks returned (when the same results as in 2) above were expected).4) Trying to select from view appl.'VW3_MyPriorityTasks' - which is a view defined using a subselect - also unexpectedly leads to an error.Note: While I could rewrite each inner join clause with changing the syntax like in 2) above  this provides a simple work-around for such cases. May be there is a work-around for subselects also (not sure if every subselect could be rewritten to a join?). However when depending on using EXISTS constructs in the query there unfortunately is no way (I would know of) to get around this problem.

The tool is invoked 15 times  and each time a new Java process is started because the Ant target has specified fork='yes'. By changing it to run the splitmessages tool in the same Java process as the one running Ant  the time is reduced to 3-4 seconds on the same machine.,10.9.1.0,10.9.1.0,0,0,98,1,6,3,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/splitmessages.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/build.xml;,0,0

It looks like most of the time is spent running the chmod Ant task on the generated scripts. There are six invocations of the chmod task  one for each script. The chmod task can operate on multiple files  so one invocation should be enough (and one invocation on six files seems to have about the same cost as one invocation on a single file).A related problem is that the scripts are always regenerated in incremental builds  even when there's nothing to do  so the binscripts target accounts for a significant part of the time it takes to run an incremental build.,10.9.1.0,10.9.1.0,0,0,117,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,build.xml;,0,0

Since it needs to go through more than 800 files  it may take a while (just half a second on the fastest machine I tested  so not a big deal  but that's still a significant portion of the total time in an incremental build).

The first jar invocation creates the jar and adds some files  and the second one updates the jars with some more files.

In particular  it doesn't add a random salt  and it only performs the hash operation once.I propose that we add two new properties that makes it possible to configure builtin to use a random salt and run multiple iterations of the hash operation: derby.authentication.builtin.saltLength - the length of the random salt to add (in bytes) derby.authentication.builtin.iterations - the number of times to perform the hash operationI'd also suggest that we set the defaults so that random salt and multiple iterations are used by default. The OWASP page mentions 64 bits of salt (8 bytes) and a minimum of 1000 iterations. I consulted a security expert who thought that these recommendations sounded OK  but he believed the recommended salt length was likely to be revised and suggested 16 bytes instead. The only price we pay by going from 8 to 16 bytes  is that we'll need to store 8 bytes extra per user in the database  so I don't see any reason not to set the default for derby.authentication.builtin.saltLength as high as 16. Setting the default for derby.authentication.builtin.iterations to 1000 will make authentication of a user somewhat slower (which is the point  really)  but experiments on my machine suggest that running our default hash function (SHA-256) 1000 times takes around 1 ms. Since authentication only happens when establishing a new connection to the database  that would be a negligible cost  I think.If saltLength is set to 0 and iterations is set to 1  the hashing will be done in the exact same way as in previous versions.Both of the properties should only be respected when the data dictionary version is 10.9 or higher  so that users in soft-upgraded databases can still log in after a downgrade.,10.9.1.0,10.9.1.0,0,0,321,1,6,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,9,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/reference/Property.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/authentication/AuthenticationServiceBase.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/authentication/BasicAuthenticationServiceImpl.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/AuthenticationTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/Changes10_6.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/Changes10_9.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/UpgradeRun.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/authentication/AuthenticationServiceBase.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/authentication/BasicAuthenticationServiceImpl.java;,1,1

When this happens the connection is leaked in the Glassfish connection pool and the client thread hangs in 'org.apache.derby.client.netReply.fill(Reply.java:172)'. Shutting down the app server fails because the thread has a lock in 'org.apache.derby.client.net.NetConnection40' and another task is calling 'org.apache.derby.client.ClientPooledConnection.close(ClientPooledConnection.java:214)' which is waiting for the lock.Killing the appsever using 'kill' and then attempting to shutdown Derby network server causes the Network Server to hang. One of the threads hangs waiting for a lock at 'org.apache.derby.impl.drda.NeworkServerControlImpl.removeFromSessionTable(NetworkServerControlImpl.java:1525)' and the 'main' thread has this locked at 'org.apache.derby.impl.drda.NetworkServerControlImpl.executeWork(NetworkServerControlImpl.java:2242)' and it itself is waiting for a lock which belongs to a thread that is stuck at 'org.apache.derby.impl.services.locks.ActiveLock.waitForGrant(ActiveLock.java:118) which is in the TIMED_WAITING state.Only by killing the Network Server using 'kill' is possible at this point.There are transactions left even though all clients have been removed.,10.1.3.1; 10.2.2.0; 10.3.3.0; 10.4.2.0; 10.5.3.0; 10.6.2.1; 10.7.1.1; 10.8.1.2; 10.8.2.2,10.5.3.1; 10.6.2.2; 10.7.1.4; 10.8.3.0; 10.9.1.0,0,1,153,1,36,5,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,4,java/engine/org/apache/derby/jdbc/XATransactionState.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/xaSimpleNegative.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/jdbcapi/XATest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/junit/Utilities.java;,0,0

Because these methods are not synchronized  between the time 'checkForNullPhysicalConnectoin' returns and 'physicalConnection' is used  the 'physicalConnection' member could be set to null and then a NPE occurs.Probably all of these methods should be changed to synchronized.,10.5.3.2; 10.8.2.2,10.5.3.2; 10.6.2.4; 10.7.1.4; 10.8.3.0; 10.9.2.2,0,5,108,1,20,6,0,1,0,0,0,0,2,2,java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/LogicalConnection.java;java/client/org/apache/derby/client/am/LogicalConnection.java;,0,0

I think it would be a good idea in 10.9 for Network Server to outright reject any network clients that are not Derby Network Client.This would eliminate confusion up front for those that might not be aware that the DB2 Universal JDBC Driver and DB2 Runtime Client are not supported. They would get a clean reasonable error instead of hitting various protocol errors.Also it would mean if someone does want to add support for some network client in the future they would at least need to add the one or two lines of code in AppRequester to identify it  which I think would be a good thing.I think the code change would not be hard but the biggest impact might be anyone who still runs tests with JCC on trunk would need to disable those tests. There is a separate issue DERBY-4785 that Jayaram is working on to complete remove the JCC related code from the tests and test infrastructure.,10.9.1.0,10.9.1.0,0,2,210,1,9,3,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,9,java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/derbynet/protocol.tests;java/drda/org/apache/derby/impl/drda/AppRequester.java;java/drda/org/apache/derby/impl/drda/DRDAConnThread.java;java/drda/org/apache/derby/impl/drda/DRDAProtocolException.java;java/drda/org/apache/derby/loc/drda/messages_en.properties;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/reference/Limits.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/derbynet/ProtocolTest.policy;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/derbynet/connect.inc;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/derbynet/protocol.tests;,0,0

These improvements caused NsTest to behave differently than it used to and they disclosed a problem in clearing the identity cache. The community lost confidence in this solution and it was backed out of the 10.8 branch under issue DERBY-5448. This new issue is filed to back the improvements out of the 10.9 trunk. Further useful discussion about how to improve the concurrency and correctness of identity columns has been taking place on DERBY-5443 and DERBY-5493.For the 10.9 release  identity columns will return to their old behavior of being ill-suited for high concurrency applications. Applications which need higher concurrency should be re-coded to use sequences rather than identity columns.,10.9.1.0,10.9.1.0,0,1,188,1,7,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,16,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/reference/Property.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/DataDictionary.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/SequenceDescriptor.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/DataDictionaryImpl.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/SequenceUpdater.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/CreateSequenceNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/NextSequenceNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/BaseActivation.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/InsertConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/InsertResultSet.java;java/storeless/org/apache/derby/impl/storeless/EmptyDictionary.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AlterTableTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/AutoIncrementTest.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/t_4437_2.dat;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/upgradeTests/Changes10_9.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/catalog/SequencePreallocator.java;,0,0

Having all the tests use the helper method would make it easier if we for example want to pass specific flags to all sub-processes created in a test run.Note that the replication tests also have code for starting processes on a remote host via ssh. BaseTestCase.execJavaCmd() cannot do that  so only local processes can be started with the helper method.

We can help translators do a better job by also writing the arguments as comments in (2).,10.10.1.1,10.10.1.1,0,1,108,1,5,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,4,5,java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/MessageBuilder.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages.xml;java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/MessageBuilder.java;java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/MessageBuilder.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages.dtd;,0,0

Instead  the JSR-169 and JDBC 3.0 implementation classes extend a common base class. The reason for this structure  is that the JSR-169 compile targets used to be optional  so the JDBC 3.0 classes could not depend on them.For example  the class javadoc comment for EmbedResultSet169 says: ResultSet implementation for JSR169. Adds no functionality to its (abstract) parent class. If Derby could be compiled against JSR169 that the parent class could be the concrete class for the environment. Just like for the JDBC 2.0 specific classes. Until that is possible (ie. easily downloadable J2ME/CDC/Foundation/JSR169 jar files  this class is required and is only compiled by an optional target.Since the JSR-169 code is no longer optional  we should do as the comment suggests  and use the base class directly instead. This would allow us to simplify the class tree.,10.10.1.1,10.10.1.1,0,1,160,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,9,java/engine/org/apache/derby/iapi/sql/dictionary/ViewDescriptor.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/EmbedCallableStatement.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/EmbedCallableStatement169.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/EmbedPreparedStatement.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/EmbedPreparedStatement169.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/EmbedResultSet.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/EmbedResultSet169.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/jdbc/build.xml;java/engine/org/apache/derby/jdbc/Driver169.java;,0,0

That is  {0} occurs in the message first  then {1}  then {2}  and so on. Sometimes  however  arguments occur out of sequence. When this happens  the names in the &lt;arg&gt; sub-elements may not agree with the order that the arguments actually occur in the message. This causes MessageBuilder to garble the dita source for the Reference Guide page titled 'SQL error messages and exceptions'.For instance  here is the messages.xml element for SQLState 22014: &lt;msg&gt; &lt;name&gt;22014&lt;/name&gt; &lt;text&gt;The start position for LOCATE is invalid; it must be a positive integer.

Satoor,2013/05/30 19:01:19 +0100,133.0009606,21.92835648,in list multi-probe by primary key not chosen on tables with >256 rows,I have a table with a long integer primary key field and 11 million rows. I seem to be unable to load large chunks of rows via id in a reasonably efficient manner. 1. If I do individual lookups via the primary key  then a fast indexed lookup occurs. However  if I do large numbers of such queries  then the time is overwhelmed by round-trip overhead which makes everything incredibly slow. 2. If I use a single query with a disjunction of the primary keys of interest  then a table scan is performed (even if the clause only contains 1-3 items)  which walks over 11 million rows...incredibly inefficient. 3. If I use an IN clause  then a table scan is performed (even if the clause only contains 1-3 items)  which walks over 11 million rows...incredibly inefficient.I'm guessing that this might have something to do with the fact that I'm using large integers and really big numbers that don't start anywhere at or about 1 for my keys. Could this possibly be confusing the optimizer?Here are the unlimited query plans for the 3 cases that I enumerated:*********************************************************************************************&#91;EL Fine&#93;: 2013-01-17 11:09:53.384-ServerSession(582235416)Connection(1430986883)Thread(Thread&#91;&quot;Initial Lisp Listener&quot; 5 SubL Thread Group&#93;)-SELECT TERM_ID  ARG0  ARG1  ARG2  ARG3  FORMULA_HASH  FORMULA_LENGTH  FORMULA_TYPE  KB_STATUS FROM KB.FORMULA_TERM WHERE (TERM_ID = ?) bind =&gt; &#91;2251799814033500&#93;Thu Jan 17 11:09:53 CST 2013 Thread&#91;&quot;Initial Lisp Listener&quot; 5 SubL Thread Group&#93; (XID = 4711079)  (SESSIONID = 3)  SELECT TERM_ID  ARG0  ARG1  ARG2  ARG3  FORMULA_HASH  FORMULA_LENGTH  FORMULA_TYPE  KB_STATUS FROM KB.FORMULA_TERM WHERE (TERM_ID = ?) ******* Project-Restrict ResultSet (3):Number of opens = 1Rows seen = 1Rows filtered = 0restriction = falseprojection = true constructor time (milliseconds) = 0 open time (milliseconds) = 0 next time (milliseconds) = 0 close time (milliseconds) = 0 restriction time (milliseconds) = 0 projection time (milliseconds) = 0 optimizer estimated row count: 1.00 optimizer estimated cost: 6.59Source result set: Index Row to Base Row ResultSet for FORMULA_TERM: Number of opens = 1 Rows seen = 1 Columns accessed from heap = {1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8} constructor time (milliseconds) = 0 open time (milliseconds) = 0 next time (milliseconds) = 0 close time (milliseconds) = 0 optimizer estimated row count: 1.00 optimizer estimated cost: 6.59 Index Scan ResultSet for FORMULA_TERM using constraint KB_FORMULA_TERM_TERM_ID_PK at read committed isolation level using share row locking chosen by the optimizer Number of opens = 1 Rows seen = 1 Rows filtered = 0 Fetch Size = 1 constructor time (milliseconds) = 0 open time (milliseconds) = 0 next time (milliseconds) = 0 close time (milliseconds) = 0 next time in milliseconds/row = 0 scan information: Bit set of columns fetched=All Number of columns fetched=2 Number of deleted rows visited=0 Number of pages visited=3 Number of rows qualified=1 Number of rows visited=1 Scan type=btree Tree height=-1 start position: &gt;= on first 1 column(s).

Given how the optimizer handles a statement  this would require binding a query plan at the query block level. Two obvious candidates for such a feature are:1) Extend the use of DERBY-PROPERTIES in the comments of a query.2) Add an extra clause to query blocks. The clause would have to be a clearly marked Derby extension.(1) might look like this (here we add a new 'fullQueryPlan' property):select tablename from sys.systables t  sys.syscolumns c  sys.sysaliases awhere t.tablename = c.columnname and c.columnname = a.alias&#8211; DERBY-PROPERTIES fullQueryPlan = (SYSCOLUMNS_HEAP # SYSALIASES_INDEX1) # SYSTABLES_INDEX1union allselect tablename from sys.systables t  sys.syscolumns c  sys.sysaliases a  sys.syssequences swhere t.tablename = c.columnname and c.columnname = a.alias and a.alias = s.sequencename&#8211; DERBY-PROPERTIES fullQueryPlan = ((SYSCOLUMNS_HEAP # SYSTABLES_INDEX1) # SYSALIASES_INDEX1) # SYSSEQUENCES_INDEX2;(2) might look like this (here we add a new 'using derby join order' clause):select tablename from sys.systables t  sys.syscolumns c  sys.sysaliases awhere t.tablename = c.columnname and c.columnname = a.aliasusing derby join order (SYSCOLUMNS_HEAP # SYSALIASES_INDEX1) # SYSTABLES_INDEX1union allselect tablename from sys.systables t  sys.syscolumns c  sys.sysaliases a  sys.syssequences swhere t.tablename = c.columnname and c.columnname = a.alias and a.alias = s.sequencenameusing derby join order ((SYSCOLUMNS_HEAP # SYSTABLES_INDEX1) # SYSALIASES_INDEX1) # SYSSEQUENCES_INDEX2;Here's a comparison of these approaches:(1)+ Portability: the same query text can be used against different RDBMSes. Parsing of DERBY-PROPERTIES happens outside the grammer.(2)+ Parsing happens in the parser. Not portable.I slightly prefer approach (1). If I pursue that approach  I would like to see if I can move the parsing into the parser.I am interested in other opinions about how to address this feature.

Satoor,2014/10/01 05:20:14 +0100,322.5222569,43.33486111,Incorrect handling when using an UPDATE to SET an identity column to DEFAULT,Derby violates the SQL Standard when an UPDATE statement SETs an identity column to the value DEFAULT. Derby does the right thing for INSERTs  however.For INSERTs  the 2011 Standard defines the meaning of DEFAULT in part 2  section 15.10 (Effect of inserting tables into base tables)  general rule 2. For INSERTs  the DEFAULT value is the next value of the sequence generator which defines the identity column.For UPDATEs  the 2011 Standard defines the meaning of DEFAULT in part 2  section 15.13 (Effect of replacing rows in base tables)  general rule 5. For UPDATEs  the DEFAULT value is also the next value of the sequence generator which defines the identity column.Note also that the 2011 Standard says that a GENERATED ALWAYS identity column can be SET to DEFAULT. Furthermore  that is the only explicit value accepted. See the 2011 Standard  part 2  section 14.15 (set clause list)  syntax rule 5:{'If &lt;set clause&gt; SC specifies an &lt;object column&gt; that references a column of which some underlying column is either a generated column or an identity column whose descriptor indicates that values are always generated  then the &lt;update source&gt; specified in SC shall consist of a &lt;default specification&gt;.'}What Derby actually does for UPDATEs is the following:1) If the column was declared GENERATED ALWAYS  then Derby raises a compile-time error saying that the value of an identity column can't be overridden.2) If the column was declared GENERATED BY DEFAULT  then Derby raises an execution time-error when trying to stuff a null into the column.Correcting this bug would result in backwardly incompatible behavior. However  I think that the incompatibility is minor: it would mean the successful run of statements which previously raised errors.I tripped across this problem while implementing the UPDATE action of the MERGE statement (DERBY-3155). If we decide to fix this bug  we will want to make sure that the UPDATE actions of MERGE statements also correctly handle DEFAULT values for identity columns.The following script shows this problem:connect 'jdbc:derby:memory:db;create=true';create table t1( a int generated always as identity  b int );create table t2( a int generated by default as identity  b int );insert into t1( a  b ) values ( default  100 );insert into t2( a  b ) values ( default  100 );update t1 set a = default;update t2 set a = default;select * from t1;select * from t2;,10.2.2.1; 10.10.1.1,10.12.0.0,0,4,393,1,20,5,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2,java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/InsertConstantAction.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/execute/UpdateConstantAction.java;,1,1

It turned out it could not get garbage collected because it was still referenced from the static HashMap _connections in ForeignTableVTI. Looking closer at ForeignTableVTI  it looks as if it only calls put() and get() on the HashMap  never remove()  so its memory footprint will keep increasing as it is used.It would be good to have some way (preferably automatic) of releasing the resources held by ForeignTableVTI when they are no longer needed.,10.11.1.1,10.10.2.1; 10.11.1.1,0,3,95,1,12,4,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,3,java/engine/org/apache/derby/vti/ForeignTableVTI.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/OptionalToolsTest.java;java/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/optional/ForeignDBViews.java;,1,1

The CastNode is replaced with a cast to the correct type during the bind phase.A NULLIF expression is turned into a CASE expression that has a THEN NULL clause. The parser simply creates an UntypedNullConstantNode for that clause  without wrapping it in a CastNode. A CastNode is instead added during the bind phase.This slight difference in how NULLs are represented by the parser in the two cases  means that ConditionalNode needs to handle the two cases differently during the bind phase. It would be better if the parser generated NULLs in the same way for the two cases  so that ConditionalNode didn't need to know if it was generated for a CASE expression or a NULLIF expression.,11.0.0.0,10.11.1.1,0,4,163,1,10,6,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,5,java/build/org/apache/derbyBuild/odbcgen_fragments.properties;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ConditionalNode.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/ValueNodeList.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/compile/sqlgrammar.jj;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/CaseExpressionTest.java;,0,0

That package is not part of the Java SE specification.

For example in SpecificAuthenticactionServiceImpl: Class sasClass = Class.forName(specificAuthenticationScheme); if (!UserAuthenticator.class.isAssignableFrom(sasClass)) { throw StandardException.newException(SQLState.AUTHENTICATION_NOT_IMPLEMENTED  specificAuthenticationScheme  'org.apache.derby.authentication.UserAuthenticator'); } UserAuthenticator aScheme = (UserAuthenticator) sasClass.newInstance();In other cases  it creates an instance without checking  and instead fails with a ClassCastException or some other exception when trying to use the instance of the incorrect type. Examples: Java5SystemProcedures SYSCS_REGISTER_TOOL()  JCECipherFactory  SequenceUpdater.makePreallocator().I think it would be good to have similar checks in these other cases too. That'll give clearer error messages which explain what the problem is  and it will be safer because it limits which constructors the users can force the Derby engine to invoke.,10.11.1.1,10.11.1.1,0,2,143,1,6,2,0,0,0,1,0,0,3,17,java/engine/org/apache/derby/catalog/Java5SystemProcedures.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages.xml;java/shared/org/apache/derby/shared/common/reference/SQLState.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/lang/OptionalToolsTest.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/sql/catalog/SequenceUpdater.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages.xml;java/shared/org/apache/derby/shared/common/reference/SQLState.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/ij.out;java/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/ij/util.java;java/tools/org/apache/derby/impl/tools/ij/utilMain.java;java/tools/org/apache/derby/loc/toolsmessages.properties;java/tools/org/apache/derby/tools/dblook.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/impl/services/jce/JCECipherFactory.java;java/engine/org/apache/derby/loc/messages.xml;java/shared/org/apache/derby/shared/common/reference/SQLState.java;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/master/encryptParams.out;java/testing/org/apache/derbyTesting/functionTests/tests/store/encryptParams.sql;,0,0

One handicap with Derby that we're not seeing with other databases is its inability to rename tables that have FK's on them. Renaming one of our tables returns this error from Derby:rename table website to weblog;Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'WP_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 30000Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'WE_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 99999Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'WC_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 99999Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'FO_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 99999Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'MF_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 99999Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'NF_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 99999Error: Operation 'RENAME' cannot be performed on object 'SQL140718163851800' because CONSTRAINT 'AP_WEBSITEID_FK' is dependent on that object.SQLState: X0Y25ErrorCode: 99999This results in the migration scripts needing to be messy  first dropping all constraints before recreating them  for the one RDBMS that requires it.
